And it got be wondering, most physicists aren't making big breakthroughs/aren't once in a generation geniuses.

    "sft_question": "Question: After giving notice about leaving the company for a role elsewhere, am I supposed to keep my new job a secret from my current coworkers? I work for a large civil engineering consulting firm. The last few times that one of my coworkers has left us to go to another company, they didn't disclose (to the manger or any coworkers) which firm they were moving to, even after everyone in our office knew they were leaving. I found this to be odd because, we work in such a tight-knit field that the day they started their new job, we all found out where they ended up through the grapevine.  I'm asking because I'll be giving my notice this week to take an offer at another firm, and I'm wondering if there's some professional etiquette that I'm not understanding.  I did some searching online before asking this question, and the only discussion I could find on the topic was suggesting that it's fine to tell your current manager where you're going unless you believe that they will try to contact your new employer and sabotage your offer. I absolutely cannot imagine my manager doing that, so I still feel perplexed why my old coworkers kept the location of their new job a secret.  Thanks for your advice.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I've always tried to avoid naming my new company, mostly because I didn't want management to come back with the: *\"Why are you going there?  That place is terrible.

You should stay here because X, Y and Z.\"*  Of course, management never wanted to have a conversation about anything BEFORE they were holding my resignation letter.  They always get real chatty after they receive it, though.  It's up to you if you want to share, if there are co-workers you like and trust.  But for me, spreading the word openly is just making it that much harder to exit cleanly without shooting my mouth off and burning a bridge."

    "sft_question": "Question: Finding a better purpose in engineering? Hi everyone,  I'm looking for advice.  I have followed a very secure path -- graduated from a top 5 mechanical engineering school and directly hired into a top aerospace company, where I've been for the past year. I thought I was hired into my dream job, but working as a design engineer in a cubicle farm makes me feel like my brain is atrophying. Working in defense as I have become more firm in my values of non-violence makes me feel icky as well. When I look around my current workplace, I'm not excited by the job that anyone around me has. I want something closer to full-brain (analytical + creative) problem-solving in my every day, for a problem that matters. I'm frustrated that engineering is so revered in society, but so far it feels like my skills are being wasted and I'm creating something bad for the world.  I don't know where to start in this search for better purpose in engineering.  I'm wondering if graduate school would help. I had an interest in controls in college but was told this field may be too \"deep\" for my liking. I'm a people person who wants to use my brain on good technology. I'm hoping graduate school would reaffirm my technical abilities and give me time/experience to better determine what kind of tech I'm interested in.  Any thoughts/advice?  Thank you!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "\"Engineering is so revered by society...\"  It is? I haven't noticed.   I'd actually directly argue against this. Engineering is grunt labor. The only reason it's at all elevated above blue collar work is because you don't literally get dirty while doing it quite as often.   The basic mentality of the public sector is \"I have an idea, it doesn't matter how difficult it is to acoustic do, I'll just get some stupid smart people to do all the work and I'll make massive money.\"  That isn't to entirely dismiss the value of people providing new ideas. That's often important, and also often people with little to no technical knowledge.  I just want you to know that people valuing you for the capabilities of your brain ended in high school. We as engineers are entirely replaceable, and viewed as such. You could be the best engineer in the world in your little niche, and maybe you're the equivalent of 3-4 \"average\" engineers. Maybe you're an anomaly and you're the equivalent of 10. Doesn't matter, you're still replaceable.  Make peace with the fact that nothing you ever do will be functionally unique. Don't expect to be applauded, it won't come. When a car wins the F1 series, the applause are for the driver. No one gives a fuck what the engineers did or the hours they put in except other engineers.   If this seems like a tangent, here's the connection: you have to derive your satisfaction from the work. It can't be pats on the back, because they won't come. It can't be respect, because it isn't there. You have to be able to stand by yourself and say \"I'm valuable because the work that i do is important, and i do it well.\" And when no one, and i mean NOT A SINGLE GODDAMN PERSON gives you props or recognition, and you're still ok, then you're there.   Engineering is not about applause. It's not about accolades. It's simply about answers. Can you provide them? Are your answers better based on the metrics provided than those of others?  If you can say yes to that you have a job, but you will never have a fan club. If that's enough, go for it. If not, seek some other line of work."

    "sft_question": "Question: Quit my summer job I’ve been working at for 3 years without notice. Boss cut my last TWO checks. Is this legal? (TX) I’ve been working as a seasonal employee for the last three years, and I recently decided to quit without notice.  An event came up three days before my shift and we’re supposed to provide written notice seven days in advance for a shift that needs to be covered. If this isn’t done, it’s a no-show, and a no-show is an automatic fire. An automatic fire is considered leaving without notice, so I jumped the gun and quit preemptively.  When I told my employer about my resignation, I was redirected to our hire packet, which has a clause that states that any quit/fire without notice is an automatic pay cut to minimum wage for all hours that have been unpaid. I was supposed to be paid for three weeks in two separate checks/pay periods as of the day I resigned, one for two weeks I had already worked and another for the two days before I quit. My employer cut my pay for both of them to minimum wage. I’m not sure if cutting pay is legal at all in the first place, and if it is i’m not sure if cutting pay for two separate pay periods, including one that had already been completed, is legal.

I will finish my PhD next year, but this week I entered the existencial crisis of a PhD: my thesis will not be good. I receive a scholarship from my government to develop my project, which I received after proposing three main objectives, two of them a bit risky but were mangeable - before covid hit. Since the pandemic began, everything I do came to a complete standstill, as I have to work on the laboratory, which was closed for almost a full year. I have a salary until July of next year, but I don't know what I will do until then or even after.  My country (brazil) is in the middile of a 3rd wave, with a 4th wave incoming. My state's healthcare system has already collapsed. Me and the other laboratory members have, since past month, made an agenda where we have no more than 2 people at the same time (so everyone has exactly one day in the week to do their work), but we all know that if we were to catch covid, it's stay at home and hope you don't die, because there is no more oxygen, hospital beds, the medicines used are slowly ending as well, and no vaccination in sight for us (in the brightest scenario, late november to mid december)  My first objective has been completely cancelled, impossible to do until late 2022, because the facility has closed. The second one involves an experimental technique that we still haven't been able to finish developing (people involved have left the city/state due to covid, facilities are still not open, purchase of new chemical reagents has been slow because everything is out of stock). The third objective requires me travelling to another side of the country (about 10h by bus) and spend some weeks working in another laboratory, something that not only is not recommended to due in the midst of our health crisis, but also I do not feel comfortable in doing as my immune system sucks and I'm very prone to getting sick, which is why I have been in quarantine for as much as I can, only leaving home for the essentials (and more recently to work).  So there we have it. I don't have anything to continue with my original plans and objectives, I don't know if I have a story to tell with all the incomplete and broken data that I have, and I'm scared shitless of having to do a complete 180º on my project which, if it's not accepted by my funding agency, they have the right to cancel my scholarship and demand that I pay them back everything that they have given me, which I mostly ceratinly cannot do. Besides changing everything when I have about 14 to 15 months left on my PhD (after this time I will be without a scholarship, and I cannot survive here without it due to money reasons), the only alternative I see is to lengthen this PhD until god knows when, when I'm finally able to complete all three objectives.

    "sft_answer": "To give a more high level response:  CPUs are designed to be pretty good at anything, since they have to be able to run any sort of program that a user might want. They’re flexible, at the cost of not being super optimized for any one particular task.  GPUs are designed to be *very* good at a few specific things, mainly the kind of math used to render graphics. They can be very optimized because they only have to do certain tasks. The downside is, they’re not as good at other things.  The kind of math used to render graphics happens to also be the kind of math used in neural networks (mainly linear algebra, which involves processing lots of numbers at once in parallel).  As a matter of fact, companies like Google have now designed even more optimized hardware specifically for neural networks, including Google’s TPUs (tensor processing units; tensors are math objects used in neural nets).

    "sft_question": "Question: why is punishment necessary for justice? actually, IS it? you know how some folks want to do away with prison? it got me wondering...aside from profit, the reason prison exists is to make criminals pay. they fucked up, so we make them miserable.  but if prison doesn't exist, if we focus on reformation instead of punishment, is that fair? is that good?  is punishment inherently needed for justice, or is there truly another way?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Justifying punishment is a difficult problem in philosophy of law because it involves both moral condemnation and infliction of harm. In liberal societies (liberal here is used in the philosophical sense, not in the everyday politics sense that describes people on the left), governments are traditionally expected to remain morally neutral most of the time and to promote the public good. It seems hard to justify harm and condemnation as consistent with neutrality and the public good. The two primary categories of justification philosophers have used are forward-looking and backward-looking theories. Forward-looking theories attempt to justify punishment by appealing to some positive effect it will have, such as deterrence. Backward-looking theories attempt to right a previous wrong or respond to a wrong that was committed, such as be seeking retribution.  The most straightforward forward-looking theory is a bare-bones consequentialist theory. Consequentialism only cares about the consequences of a decision, so punishment would only be justified if it had some good effect. There are problems with consequentialist theories, primarily their lack of consistency and lack of respect for individual rights. Murphy lays out these problems and justifies his own retributive theory of punishment in chapter 4 of this book. That chapter will give you a good idea of this whole problem if you want to read it.  Murphy’s retributive theory of punishment is backward-looking and seeks to right a wrong and restore justice to the community. He is explicitly against merely seeking retribution for retribution’s own sake. That would be the lex talionis or “eye for an eye” view, which is unpopular. Rather, Murphy’s view is that when a crime has been committed, a wrong has been done to the community’s shared sense of what is right. An injustice has occurred. In order to restore justice to the community, the criminal must be punished. In Murphy’s view, the criminal is being punished not simply as revenge, but in order to restore justice.  Kelly criticizes Murphy’s view in this paper. Kelly believes Murphy’s approach does not avoid retributivism’s problems. She puts forward her own forward-looking view based primarily on deterrence, but she also seeks to avoid consequentialism’s pitfalls. Kelly’s theory relies on treating all criminals equally and giving them all fair warning. In Kelly’s view, this equality and fairness is sufficient to retain a respect for individual dignity and justice even as criminals are punished. Kelly realizes the we cannot simply blame criminals for their actions, but she thinks that punishment can still be just if it is done in the right way. So Kelly recognizes objections about a criminal’s circumstances, and thinks her theory gets around it.  Meanwhile, there are those who believe that punishment is unjustified, and are unconvinced by both forward- and backward-looking theories. These philosophers typically endorse restorative justice as an alternative, which seeks to rehabilitate criminals and right any wrongs without punishment. I am less familiar with these theories, but you can read more about them here. I linked the section of an encyclopedia article about restorative justice, but I’d bet that whole article would be illuminating.  Hope this helps"

I (37m) recently received a new title at work of 'Applications Engineer'. I'm a long time CNC machinist and programmer that manages our CAD/CAM systems. I implement new processes and train folks on both our CAD and CAM platforms. I also write some scripts from time to time with Python, SQL, VBA, and Fanuc Macro B for task that we either want to simplify, automate, or just happens to be complex and would warrant it. I'm relatively proficient at CAD design, even have a product I helped a friend develop on the side which you can buy in Cabela's, Bass Pro Shops, and other big stores of that nature.  That being said, I personally asked for this specific title as it's a role in my industry (CNC Machine Tool Programming) that I want to further my career in. Essentially becoming a subject matter expert for a future company. However, some in my group feel that 'Engineer' in the job title is only for those who have degrees and it's a disservice to those who do have them. They also won't call the only person in our group an 'Engineer' because he's fresh out of school(with a BA in EE) and doesn't have the experience.  So, I want to pose a question to the community, where do you draw the line between Engineer and non-Engineers with regards to titles and duties? Do you make the distinct line for degree holders and non-degree holders?\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: Are any schools particularly well known for their undergraduate philosophy education? I TA a class that meets in a maximum security prison and one of the students is getting released soon. He's expressed a desire to study philosophy once he gets out and has asked the professor and I for a list of schools where he might want to do that. Bracketing for the time being the practical factors involved in this decision, what should we tell him? I know what the top schools for graduate study are, and I assume their undergraduate programs are accordingly good to at least some extent, but are there any schools that have a particular reputation for quality undergrad philosophical education? I feel like I've heard UMKC brought up before in this regard, am I making that up? Thanks.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Echoing the other comments, I don't think people usually compare undergrad education in *philosophy specifically*, so there's probably not going to be much reliable information available on this.  However, you could look for institutions known for their undergrad education *generally* and look at the philosophy departments at those institutions. If the institution is known for undergrad education generally and its philosophy faculty is good, the philosophy course listings sufficiently diverse, etc., then that's probably a good sign (though, of course, by no means a guarantee).  If admissions weren't a factor, I'd recommend the top undergrads. The class sizes are small, the professors teach the courses/lead the seminars, the students are interested in the subject, and many offer related special programs (e.g. Yale has a Directed Studies program which covers the \"great\" works of the western canon)."

    "sft_question": "Question: I am student in a lab, another student is constantly asking me for help and I don't know how I should deal with it I am currently one of a small number of students in a lab doing a research project. Our projects are independent but are very similar with a lot of overlap between them. We are quite a close group and therefore often arrange to go into the lab at similar times and we all help each other out e.g. if someone is going to get reagents they will get enough for all of us, etc. However, there is one student in the group who is constantly asking me for help. I did not mind at first but I have now become this person's default person to ask for help. However the help is not the occasional question such as asking for my general opinion or checking their working out for a calculation but constant questions about nitty gritty details of their experiment to the point where they want me to basically outline what they should do that day.  &#x200B;  To put it kindly, and I know I may get flamed for saying this, this student is clueless. They have very poor English which means they cannot follow what is being discussed in lab meetings with our supervisor and they cannot comprehend what our supervisor wants us to do. They do not seem to understand much, from the general overarching theory behind the projects, to how to perform calculations (which are the same calculations we have been using for weeks now), to how to use a computer (let alone the complex software we need to use to analyze our results). I know this sounds horrible and unkind and I know they cannot help having a language barrier but I am burnt out from all of the extra help I have been giving them. For example, I spend time explaining how to get data off of the computer software and put it onto a USB drive, something that is simple to do, and I mean I really broke it down into baby steps which they wrote down, this week they still had me show them three more times and then when I was out of the lab they asked our other lab mate to save the files to their USB for them... It is just so hopeless. I spend three hours showing them how to use the software which we had been taught a couple of days before by our supervisor but because the supervisor speaks too quickly for them to understand so once again I really broke it down, but the questions they ask just show me that they have no comprehension or understanding of the software or the reasons why we are doing certain steps.   &#x200B;  I am at the point where I need to step back for the sake of my mental health and academic integrity. I know that without my help they would be completely lost but I am at the point where I do not care, they are not earning their degree this way. They do not deserve the degree. However, it is all well me saying that I do not want to help them anymore but they are quite manipulating. We are both, obviously, adults but this student is significantly older than me and I find it hard to say no to them. When they ask me questions I try and deflect and say they should ask our supervisor for help and they say \"no I want to ask you as you are good at this\" or some variation of that. They always want to come in the lab the same time as me so the past few days I have been purposely misleading them saying vague things like \"I might come in the morning\" and then not showing up until noon. However, I did this the other day and they sat at the lab bench from 9am to 11:30am waiting for me. Two and a half hours they sat there and did no work, just waiting for me because they had no clue what they were supposed to be doing. Even at the weekend and evenings they are messaging me and phoning me with questions.   &#x200B;  Our supervisor knows this student struggles with their English and they struggle academically, they know I help this student a lot and am patient with them. I don't feel like I can go to an academic and basically say to her \"hey your student is not fit to be in the lab\". It is just not my place.   &#x200B;  I would really appreciate any advice or suggestions you have on this situation. It is a difficult situation. I know on the surface it seems like I am moaning about helping a fellow student out but it is the magnitude of the amount of help they require and the lack of efficacy of the hours of explaining and extra help I am giving them is having which is the problem.\nAnswer: ",

It’s so easy to think to yourself that saying NO should be sufficient but it’s a lot harder to do with someone who is both in need and struggling and also being a leech like in your case.   What I have found works is telling your supervisor about it will help, but not in an accusatory way, more in a neutral manner like some of the other comments above.  Have a honest chat with this group member and tell them you’re burnt out and can’t help at this level anymore. Tell them to seek classes or professional courses or tutoring idk whatever kind of help they need and tell them “I can’t help continuously, occasionally for a quick 5 minute check yes, more than that, I’m sorry no, please don’t ask me anymore because then I can’t do my own work and I will suffer for it”. Block them if you feel comfortable doing that. On the phone block their number, unfriend them. Whatever is necessary for your wellbeing and have your supervisor talk to them too about how much help is appropriate to ask from others."

I loathe having to ask this, it feels like the most petty situation on the planet, but it’s becoming a major point of contention among my staff, and as a manager I don’t know how to handle it.   Background: Small non-profit, 10 person staff. Of those 10 staff 9 are females and we share a women’s restroom. It’s a private one toilet with a door restroom.   We have a newer staff member who will go into the restroom for 15-20 minutes at a time 3+ times a day. To the point every time someone else tries to use the restroom she is in there.  At first we though, maybe it’s a temporary thing, not feeling well, etc. However it has not improved, if anything it’s more frequent/longer times. Other staff members have come to me complaining and more recently started gossiping and complaining to each other about it. Every time we go to look for her to ask her to start a different task she’s in the restroom, and she’ll be in there for extended periods while others need to use it. They could use the men’s, they’re essentially unisex bathrooms, but they don’t want to use it after our male employee(understandably).   It’s turning into a major issue with staff and there is growing animosity. Today the employee in question and I were the only ones in office and I had to manage our front deskthat’s within eyeshot of the bathroom, so I started a log. She spent 1:27 minutes of her 8hr shift in the restroom today.  It’s certainly at the top of my list that this could/likely be a medical problem. The LAST thing I want to do is manage someone’s restroom breaks. We’re grown adults, go when you need to, blow it up (and clean it) if you need to. I have bigger fish to fry, but we’re past the point of being able to ignore it.   Please, please help me out here.

    "sft_question": "Question: 1st Year PhD - Removed From Project Until recently I was a 1st year PhD student working on my project. However, I was dismissed following my viva under the guise of \"poor writing\" in a continuation report for transfer into the 2nd year. Initially shocked at this sudden change from my supervisor, as we meet weekly to touch base and my writing ability has never been raised as a concern. Going back through the assessors feedback comments from the initial draft, it was generally positive or constructive. i.e make figure x larger, move paragraph y above z. Overall, the report and oral viva were praised for well thought out discussions, sound methodology, good results and clear progression/future plans (all documented) with just a vague \"introduction is poorly written\". However, when pressed the assessor could not/would not expand on this, dismissing me with \"its all poor\" contrary to the feedback he himself had provided! I was told my only options at this stage are to \"withdraw from your course, or submit an MPhil but I will not accept it\". Thus I am appealing this verdict.  After speaking with various staff and peers it has become obviously clear to everyone who has heard the situation that you would not remove someone for poor writing, if that is indeed the case. Institutional guidelines recommend to advise relevant training, workshops, exercises and teaching to address a students weaknesses. I believe this serves as wrongful dismissal/ not adhering to due process of the university. So I've raised this further to the senior staff.  It has also come to my attention that the lab I was part of is notorious for politics and shady conduct. The student who had the project before me was bullied into leaving. In addition to a high staff turn-over, improper conduct and breaches of contract. From what I hear the uni does nothing about it because the head brings in too much money. \"Poor writing\" just seems to be the excuse to get rid of me, or the project is cursed! Advice on how to navigate this matter would be appreciated.  If the appeal goes through it's doubtful I'll get my previous post/project back as there is too much bad blood. I wouldn't be comfortable remaining at the university if I was moved to another lab/project, if there is systematic abuse and underhanded deals going on. My supervisor is not happy about me digging around/appealing so wouldn't give me a shining reference so seek positions elsewhere.  I've kept and backed up logs of meetings where no measures were put in place, emails where the supervisor, team and peers have all said the report was of a good standard, and presentations where no concerns were raised. At its core it began as a wrongful dismissal and academic appeal, but the more I look into it, ask around and hear from others experiences with the lab. There's documented evidence of abuse of power, discrimination, harassment/bullying among other serious allegations that the university HAS known about ...but have just brushed  under the rug because they bring in too much money! Not what I would expect from the 18th ranked UK University.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I keep telling everyone this, UK  higher academia is **HIGHLY UNREGULATED**. It is very easy to pass incompetent people on a PhD programme and kick out competent people on a PhD programme. There are no exams (in most universities to an extent, though some make you do MRes) and very few formal records of what is going on (I had three annual reviews, a transfer viva and viva). If they want to mess around with you, it's very easy. If you smell a rat, run. Don't waste 4 years only to be shown the door with a MPhil. Or even worse they take your 4 years, take your money, take your effort and kick you out right at the viva with no resubmission.  If you don't trust your supervisor, **DO NOT** and I repeat **DO NOT** stay. He or she is the only one who is going to back you at the viva. If you think your supervisor is out to get you, start recording and documenting evidence. Make a complaint and leave. These people will never let you pass if they don't want to.

    "sft_answer": "I don't know of a data center that uses open loop cooling (dumping heated water).  What I do know of is evap cooling. In this case, you have a closed loop, with radiators outside. Those radiators operate passively (well, with fans) for most of the time. You can spray water on the radiators, and the evaporating water will help cool down the loop. (In these systems there are still usually chillers, to bring the water down to the correct temperature, but letting radiators do most of the work ahead of time is more energy efficient)  What I could see working, though I don't know of any facilities that do this, is having river water or ocean water pumped over those radiators.

So in my personal opinion, to have only 2 parties, both of which being completely opposite In view, is somewhat detrimental to progress. From what I’ve seen, if you go too far into 1 belief like for instance left or right leaning views, then it ultimately descends into fanaticism and dictatorship.  Now these may not be the best examples, but here are two of the biggest and most obvious ones : the nazis and Stalinism. Both are examples of leaning way too far into one belief to the point that it ultimately descends into a dictatorship. Now of course there were multiple factors that made both things horrible of course, but I feel that both being essentially as far right and left leaning as possible respectively is a contributor.  But I’d rather digress and get to the main point. When you have two sides that are both entirely dedicated to one side of the argument then you get no progress as both sides will be completely unable to be convinced on the other sides arguments.

Having a third political party is the situation we're in right now and you're not happy, yea? We apparently need something else.  The root of the problem you're concerned about here is the first-past-the-post election system, which from a game theory perspective inevitably leads to only two major parties regardless of how many parties there actually are. There's nothing in law anywhere saying we have can only have two parties, and, in fact, we don't have two parties. It's the first past the post system that causes people to vote for \"the lesser of two evils\" and results in only two dominant parties and a bunch of others with no real chance at winning. And even if one of those other parties becomes dominant all it does is replace one of the two dominant parties (this has happened previously in the US, ex when the Whig party fell into meaninglessness).   So what you actually think we need is not a 3rd party (we have plenty of those), what you probably think we need is something like ranked choice voting, which does not lead to two dominant parties."

In general, after baking cookies, do you keep the cookies on the hot sheet for a few minutes, or transfer immediately to a wire rack? Specifically, thick cookies. For example, this recipe:  https://www.modernhoney.com/levain-bakery-chocolate-chip-crush-cookies/   It says to bake at 410F for 9-12 minutes, but it's always undercooked in the center. I think having it a little undercooked is fine, but my results usually have it way undercooked. I was wondering if it would be wise to keep the cookies on the sheet so it continues to cook more after taking it out of the oven.   Is there a rule of thumb for how long the cookies should be kept on the hot sheet after coming out of the oven?\nAnswer: ",

My grandma who is 83's birthday is coming up. She has dementia and is in hospice care. My family has decided we want to make my grandma some dishes from her childhood for her birthday.   There is a dish that she served me as a child that she loved that I would like to identify and make but no one in my family knows what it is.   It is a sort of breaded and fried vegetable that is commonly served in the west and south of the United States. I asked my Mom and she said she thought it might be fried okra. But I googled the recipe and it doesn't look quite right. The vegetable inside the breaded fried balls is sort of soft and orange color and seems to have been mashed or pureed. The taste is very rich and creamy bordering on sweet taste. I'm wondering if it could be sweet potato or carrot but none of those come up when I do a google search.   I also remember these being served at buffet's growing up as a kid in the western u.s. if that helps identify what it could be.   If there is another sub that might be able to answer this type of question I would appreciate being pointed in that direction.\nAnswer: ",

There are a lot of fancy ingredients out there whose prices are hard to justify for the average home cook.

I've used them and they're good, but I honestly can't tell the difference between them and a cheap $0.99 can with a bit of extra sugar in pretty much all of the recipes I make.

    "sft_question": "Question: PhD students: How do you manage to do your daily chores with such long hours? How does your daily routine look like? Non-native English speaker here.   I keep on reading here that PhD students work for 11-13 hour workdays.   My question is, give the high work hours how do you manage to do other daily chores that are a requirement of life. For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me at the moment.   PS: I am asking because I am out of home from 8am to 9:30pm. I can't even brush my teeth or shampoo properly given the time even though I have my food, lunches prepared and home and other chores maintained. It sounds impossible that other people are doing so much with a more constrained time than me. I want to do a PhD and I don't know if it will even be possible to do the chores listed above if I can't do them now. So I am looking for inspiration for time management.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The answer to this varies based on where you fall in the PhD sequence, and on how rigorous your program is. It is not static. Why? Because the constraints, demands, and obligations that you deal with throughout the process are not static. I get the sense that most people responding here are either in programs with little coursework requirements or are later on in their sequences-- that is, responding from the stage at which they've already done qualifying exams and are not being forced to take a full courseload along with doing research. Post-quals/post advancement to candidacy = a generally more flexible stage that allows you to get marginally closer to a semi-normal home life. (Emphasis on \"marginally.\")  &#x200B;  If we're talking about the first third or half of the PhD, my answer (coming from a very rigorous R1 program) is the following: you manage only a couple of things you've listed above, only barely, and if you're lucky. Many of them might happen only sporadically. If you have a partner living with you to help you, you might be better off. You will have very little time for these mundane things. The first few years of the PhD are like a time warp.  &#x200B;  If you're in your first few years and have a full set of graduate courses (e.g. 4 per semester, in my case) you simply don't have time. I spent my first year under such a heavy reading and workload that I was living on about 4-5 hours of sleep for the whole year; I wasn't going out, was constantly turning down hangouts with friends, had to tell people that I didn't have time to date. At all. And even then, I still wasn't getting all of the reading done. Sometimes I'd get all of my reading done but had gotten so little sleep that I couldn't always remember details immediately when being questioned on the spot...which got me accusations from my advisor of not doing the readings (yeah, I was angry. Asshole). I was pretty burnt out by the end of that year, unsurprisingly. It felt like academic hazing. And truthfully, I think it kind of was. It wasn't healthy, wasn't sustainable, wasn't reasonable or right. I could barely take care of basics like laundry (and even now, I still go a while without it sometimes, as life is still a whirlwind and I have qualifying exams in two weeks and feel way underprepared-- really hard to justify more time wasted).  &#x200B;  One thing that I realized by the end of that year is that there is truly **never** enough time, and every choice is a sacrifice. Whatever I choose to read, I'm choosing over another thing that I'm supposed to read. Whatever I choose to do is further sacrificing getting things done, no matter what. So you have to prioritize things that you'll get into tangible trouble for if you don't complete them. One example: do I wash my sheets and make my bed properly for the first time in months, or do I read and finish a paper that I need to present on in two hours? Every day, ad infinitum, because the obligations like this are just repeated every week. I realized that I had to choose explicitly to *not* complete some of my work in order to do things like go out for dinner or have any semblance of a social life, maintain basic friendships, etc. I had to cut out all extra work that I could possibly get away with not doing, and it still adds up to a lot. I'm slightly more balanced now but still find it hard to complete a lot of the things you've listed.  &#x200B;  Pro tips I've learned personally or from others over time:  * If you have the money, automated delivery services for groceries, toiletries, or ready-made meals really help. * Get used to being able to spare only 15 minutes for a quick run in the morning, at best. Often you might not be able to do so at all. * Living with or dating a normie/non-academic with an average work-life balance will make \"life maintenance\" logistics easier at home. * But at the same time, non-academics often find it hard to deal with our schedules and might become frustrated or resentful-- I'm not sure whether I'd be able to relate as well to a partner outside of academia at this point. My current partner is also an academic (with an equally terrible schedule) and I am virtually certain that this is the only reason I'm able to maintain it."

Do you know what this sounds like? It sounds like the guy who goes around saying that morbidly obese people are just slobs who are completely disinterested in their own health.

It even sounds like the guy who goes around saying that suicidal people just don't want help and probably deserve the things that they do to themselves. Why else would they emotionally push away people who try to understand their situation and help them?  &#x200B;  Most of the issues you've raised just boil down to you begging the question. Before you can reasonably claim that opposing Medicare for All means that one must not care about suicide, you have to unequivocally prove that the lack of Medicare for All significantly contributes to the incidence of suicide and that implementing Medicare for All would significantly reduce or outright eliminate the incidence of suicide."

    "sft_question": "Question: How do you deal with impostor syndrome and general self-doubt in academia/research? Hello everyone, I am a female undergraduate in physics at a reputable university. I will be graduating in a year and am starting to look at PhD programs. Recently I joined a new research group in a subject that I am highly interested in, but do not have a lot of background in. Prior to this I was in a research group for a little over a year, but in a completely different field. The second I heard back from the new group I basically had a panic attack: I felt fraudulent, like I somehow tricked them into saying yes; thoughts that I'm not smart or accomplished enough keep crossing my mind even still.   I've heard of impostor syndrome and realized that what I'm experiencing is consistent with some of the things I've heard about it; however, just recognizing that what I'm experiencing is normal doesn't help very much. I feel a lot of self-doubt and I find myself avoiding the work for the group because I'm afraid of not understanding something and looking stupid. I know a lot of graduate students go through this, so what are some tips to help get over this self doubt and fear of failure?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Maybe hearing the perspective of the other side will help.  When an undergrad joins our research group I always assume that they don't know anything (most of the time that's true).  We've all been there before.   I didn't know anything when I first joined as an undergrad and it was really scary.  I would sit in on our research meetings and have no idea what the hell anyone was talking about.  Now I'm the one rambling on in the meetings while the undergrads sit there and wonder what the hell I'm talking about.  It just takes time.  Everyone I know prefers the student who asks too many questions over the student who doesn't ask anything.  Students who don't ask questions end up costing us way more time in the end.  Like I said, we've all been there before.  Nobody is born with this knowledge in their brains, and the big secret in academia (well, really the entire world) is that nobody actually knows what the hell is going on.  Ask questions, no matter how simple.  I'm a 2nd year PhD student and just this week I had to ask my advisor how to calculate a confidence interval around a sample proportion (for the record that's a 2nd year undergrad topic in my field).  Just make sure you project a willingness to learn on your own provided they can point you in the right direction.  Professors are busy people and they don't always have time to teach undergrads everything they need to know.  Edit: Something a bit more practical is to retain perspective on the world around you.  I have old friends who dropped out of community college to do heroine and work at fast food joints.  It's messed up and of course I try to help if I can, but things like that help me keep a balanced perspective on life.

    "sft_answer": "> Could somebody please point me to an explanation of why this is the case?  Let's say my thesis is \"There has been habitat destruction threatening the conversation of polar bear populations in the past fifty years.\" Let's adopt, for sake of discussion, the thesis that absence of evidence is evidence of absence. Let's suppose no one has done any significant studies of polar bear populations and habitat considering the last fifty years. Then, we get an argument like this:  1. There is no evidence that in the past fifty years polar bear habitats have been destroyed in ways that threaten their populations.    2. If there's no evidence for X, X is false.    3. Therefore, it's not true that in the past fifty years polar bear habitats have been destroyed in ways that threaten their populations.  This is a terrible argument, because the fact that we haven't inquired into X is no reason to think X is false. For this reason, reasonable people reject the thesis that absence of evidence is evidence of absence.  Let's consider a different scenario: one where we've taken significant steps to assess the evidence regarding polar bear populations and habitats, and not found any support for the thesis in question. Then we get an argument like this:  1. The evidence fails to support the thesis that there has in the last fifty years been destruction of habitat that threatens polar bear populations.    2. If the evidence fails to support X, X is false.    3. It's not true that in the last fifty years there has been destruction of habitat that threatens polar bear populations.  This is a sensible argument.  The confusion here seems to arise from people failing to distinguish between these two very different sorts of arguments. There's a significant difference between \"We have gathered significant evidence which fails to support X\" and \"We haven't gathered evidence that supports X\", but the throw-away expression \"absence of evidence\" isn't clear about which one of these two things it means, so the result is a great deal of confusion on this topic.  > Is this really not controversial in philosophy?  I don't think the foregoing is controversial in philosophy."

    "sft_question": "Question: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...\"exits\", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Not a doctor - my dad has bowel issues and my mum has Coeliac so I've seen the inside of many bowel clinics.  If the particles are microscopic how can you see them? Are you sure there's not an anxiety/psychological element to this?  The scope can only go so far without doing damage, it was probably a sigmoidoscopy? Anyway if she was impacted it would have saw that or sent her to A&E when she took the Kleen-prep.  If she's eating rubbish and not drinking enough then why aren't you doing anything about it? Your super market might not sell Romanian goods but it definitely sells fresh meat, cheese, veg and pulses. Cook books and YouTube will tell you what to do with these, no point saying your diet is crap and not doing anything about it. You can buy soluble fibre to add to the diet too if you think that will help. As for fluids, there's no excuse for that - there's plenty of water in the tap.  You might want to cut back on the wiping, it must be damaging to be constantly rubbing down there, she might want to try actually bathing after going to the toilet (look up hip bath).   You need to double book a GP appointment and explain everything that's going on, including the 3 hour marathon cleaning sessions to get a picture of what's going on here."

But, it doesn't pay much (in case of master's, not at all), it's a fair amount of work (def 40 hours+) that requires high concentration and thus is less than ideal to be done while watching a child, not all institutions are fully supportive (and some will pull stunts like take away grad students' health insurance a month before matriculation...), and the life after a PhD is precarious in most fields geographically and income wise.   fwiw not in wildlife science but a few of my college buddies went on to work for national parks and they have just BAs, often in bio but just as often in random stuff like American Studies."

(x-post from r/sushi) To celebrate my one-year anniversary in my sushi restaurant, I bought my own yanagiba because the restaurant knives get really dull from use by other employees. There's supposed to be only one person to sharpen the knives but I just found out the other employees (who are inexperienced) take their hand at the waterstone which just fucks up the knives even further.   Anyway, back to my point. As a left-handed newbie knife owner, I bought a cheap right-handed yanagiba for $20 before I commit to a more expensive knife. Immediately after one use, I noticed that it's prone to oxidizing very quickly. I keep it clean every day by scrubbing dish soap on it with the rough side of the sponge and it seems to work for a while but I have a feeling I'm doing this wrong. After a week I notice it's got a lot of tarnishes on it and has a strong smell of metal. Is this normal? What's a better way to clean knives?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Hi!  I spend 7 months in Japan for an internship, and during my time there, one of the things I did was to nerd out on the subject of japanese knifes.   First of all, japanese chefs often prefer carbon steel knives because of its superior edge holding ability and ease of sharpening compared to stainless steel. One side effect of this is that the knives rust. Leaving a knife to rust will cause discoloration. The patina is not a big issue - for many western chefs, a dark patina is considered a proof of their hard work. While the patina is not an issue, leaving a knife wet also causes the edge to rust - meaning your knife will become dull if not properly cared for.   The best and only way to prevent your knife from rusting is to wipe it when it's not in use. Even if you're just gonna leave your knife for 10-15 minutes, wipe it dry. Not \"kinda dry\", really dry. Keep a towel only for keeping your knife dry.   When I say dry, one salesman in tokyo told me to dry the knife with a hairdryer at the end of each day. While this is not necessary, it says alot of how important it is to keep your knife dry.   Also, to keep your knife clean, don't use tough sponges that might wear on the edge, use soft ones or towels together with some plain soap.   Another thing that helps you keep your knife sharp is a good sharpening steel. A common misconception is that a sharpening steel actually makes your edge sharper. It doesn't. It just re-aligns the edge after it's been slightly bent after a days work, so the edge can \"attack\" the food from the right angle.   To keep your knife deadly sharp, invest in a sharpening stone. There are different \"grains\" on sharpening stone, and generally, the lower the number is the rougher the grain is. For everyday sharpening, I recommend a 1000-grain stone and a 6000-grain stone to finish the edge. while a 1000-grain stone is enough for most people, the 6000-grain gives your edge that last bit of polish that is needed for working with sushi.   While I hate the Global-brand more than anything, it's ridiculously overpriced, and not that good to start off with, they do have a great video where a japanese chef shows you how to sharpen your knife with a stone. It's truly a great tutorial, it takes alot of practice but when you get it right, you can make your knife sharper than any professional knife shop with just a couple of minutes work.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw5ChGOADE  If you want get yourself a real, expensive yanagiba, I reccomend you get a knife from the tokyo-branch of Aritsugu. The aritsugu family has been in the sword&knife-making business since the fifteen hundreds, and this shop is where most people go from the Tokyo Tsukuji Fish Market to get knives and I've had several japanese sushi chefs recommend me this brand. The prices of their knifes aren't too bad, I got myself an incredible Aritsugu A-style 24 cm Wa-gyuoto (chefs knife) for about 150 dollars. Check it out at:  http://aritsugu.jp/   A site I learned alot from is Z-knives. That guy goes ridicously in depth in this knife reviews and even tests and compares steels used in different knives. It's a great read.   http://zknives.com/knives/kitchen/ktknv/indexall.shtml  If you have any more questions about caring for your knifes or buying new knives, I'll be happy to answer any questions."

I mean, what really pushed anakin to the dark was the lack of being able to tell anyone about his true problems, and he more or less did function in a gray manner, utilizing both the dark and light, but only for good during tcw, would he have prospered under an order that allowed him more freedom?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In modern continuity the thing with the Dark Side is that it is a seductive force. The Dark Side in lore isn't like the Dark Side in video games, it's not just \"Red ability bad\" you can use the force in any number of ways it's **how** you use it that determines if its giving in to the dark side. What dictates whether throwing out your hand results in a Force Push or a blast of Force Lightning is more than just intent. It's not enough to WANT Force Lightning, you have to have the aggression to manifest it. The raw, living rage to turn the live energy of the universe into a manifestation of your own anger and desire to harm another being.   The more you use the force for negative actions the more tempted you will be to continue to do so. It's like a narcotic, you can't switch it on and off, its the living embodiment of \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"  One of the downsides of learning to use the Force is that you are committing to living a life of resisting the urge to use the force in negative ways. That's part of why the Jedi have age limits for training. The older you get, the more your personality and mentality have been molded, and the more difficult it is to mold you into the kind of person suited for a Jedi's life style. Anakin had the absolute worst temperament for a Jedi, but thats not his only problem, his biggest problem is one that Qui-Gon Jinn wouldn't be able to solve without going Dark himself.     Anakin Skywalker is a slave boy who was confined and restricted all through childhood.  He gets freed by a Jedi, and is then taken to a new place where he  was confined and restricted. When he gets there he's exposed to a manipulator who quietly tells him, at every opportunity, how awful it was that he's confined and restricted.      You want Anakin Skywalker to remain a jedi? You don't need to keep Qui-Gon Jinn, you need to get *rid* of Sheev Palpatine.      To see why I say this consider Ahsoka Tano, Anakin's own padawan. She was raised within the temple as a child. She was taught patience, restraint, humility, and all that other jazz by a great Jedi mentor while she was a youngling. She's then introduced to Anakin Skywalker, The Chosen One, Hero for the Clone Wars, and although he is impetuous, disobedient, and someotimes downright violent, she emerges from his training honed into the sort of force user most Jedi could only dream of being. She's trained by Anakin, encouraged in all her impulsive feelings and gut instincts, but instead of falling the way he does, she ends up becoming more like Qui-Gon Jinn than he could ever hope to be.  This shows that it's not purely Anakin's personality that's a problem, because he imbues it into Ahsoka and she surpasses her master in her dedication to the tenants of peace and harmony with the Force and the universe.  Anakin Skywalker's greatest problem didn't lie within himself, but with the company he kept.   &#x200B;  Maybe Qui-Gon could have been the father figure he needed, and could have persuaded him to stay away from Palpatine, but that seems unlikely. Palpatine was a master of manipulation. He wanted Anakin Skywalker, he would do whatever it took to get him. The only real way to save Anakin would be to remove Palpatine from the equation."

    "sft_question": "Question: [Sympathy for the Devil]What is the logical argument he's trying to make to evoke sympathy? He introduces himself as wealthy and having taste and having lived a long time, but none of those things are an indication of morality nor immorality.  \"Taking men's souls\" may be considered merely his job, and the morality of which souls he takes (the sinful ones) is not indicated explicitly. This is also not an indication therefore of morality or immorality.  His speech seems to ramble, and I have a hard time finding any conclusions he's trying to make. Overall it seems to be a desperate distraction to confuse the mind rather than make any actual argument.  Please clarify.  For completeness sake, the lyrics in full:  Please allow me to introduce myself   I'm a man of wealth and taste   I've been around for a long, long year   Stole many a man's soul to waste  And I was 'round when Jesus Christ   Had his moment of doubt and pain   Made damn sure that Pilate   Washed his hands and sealed his fate  Pleased to meet you   Hope you guess my name   But what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game  I stuck around St. Petersburg   When I saw it was a time for a change   Killed the czar and his ministers   Anastasia screamed in vain  I rode a tank   Held a general's rank   When the blitzkrieg raged   And the bodies stank  Pleased to meet you   Hope you guess my name, oh yeah   Ah, what's puzzling you   Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  I watched with glee   While your kings and queens   Fought for ten decades   For the gods they made  I shouted out   Who killed the Kennedys?

    "sft_answer": "The devil isn't making an argument to evoke sympathy.  He's warning you politely and with class \"be nice to me in person or I'll f you up.\"  To recap, earlier in the song he says he's a man of wealth and taste.  The song only says sympathy once, so we should look for the meaning in the immediate vicinity of the word before we look for it elsewhere:  \"So if you meet me  Have some courtesy  Have some sympathy, and some taste  Use all your well-learned politesse  Or I'll lay your soul to waste, mm yeah\"  TRANSLATION: So if you meet me, be courteous, sympathetic, and tasteful. Use all your well-learned etiquette ... or I'll destroy your soul.  Now \"sympathy\" has two meanings.  Here are Bing's definitions.  1)  It can mean \"feelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune.\" 2) It can also mean \"understanding between people; common feeling\" as in comaraderie, fellowship, and/or harmony.  A weak argument can be made that he's asking for the first type of sympathy.  Elsewhere he's insinuating that it is you, a human, and not him that is the true monster.   However, in line with the other items on his list, he is asking for the second type of sympathy (comaraderie) rather than the first type (pity).  Edit: Grammar"

    "sft_question": "Question: A bakery near me \"glazes\" their danishes in something that keeps them crispy. Any ideas what it might be? There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is. I don't \\*think\\* they are merely blowtorching sugar onto the pastry because it's not burnt. I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity). I've also tried rolling the dough in sugar before forming the danish like a kouign amann, which was good but far from their effect.  &#x200B;  Are there other ideas I may be missing?

    "sft_question": "Question: Eli5: How can a plants roots survive in a cup of water (root cuttings, propagation), when the same plant planted in soil can be drown if you over water it?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Overwatering your plants kill them (mainly) for two reasons: lack of oxygen and/or root rot. It's also important to mention that plants breath (absorve oxygen) through both their leaves and their roots, since they aren't very good moving the oxygen through out their bodies: they breath through \"pores\" and the oxygen only serves nearby cells.   Water (usually) doesn't contain as many bacteria, fungi or small animals (nematodes) as soil does. Fungi loves moist soil, if the soil is damp it will multiply and cause root rot, killing your plant.  Not only that, all those little animals and fungi also use oxygen and will compete with your plant for it. Damp soil means more animals and also less oxygen pockets. Plants breath easier in soil but in water there's not so much competition for the available oxygen, so the plant does not die, it grows more roots to take better advantage of the situation."

My boss does not know I have ADHD and has given me more than enough reasons to not trust him with that information.  Recently, working out in the morning has given me enough momentum to work constantly throughout the day but there is still the lack of detail in things and thinking much faster than I speak. It has helped me prioritize other duties as well compared to in the past where I was only doing actual work for like 2 hours.  My lab note taking was terrible until I started using Notion so my data, notes, experimental methodology and such is organized and in a consistent pattern. That's another thing, patterns in my daily routine have been helpful. Not so much like a strict routine but identifying the easiest or menial tasks and doing those first to build up momentum and motivate myself to work throughout the day.  That all being said, focusing for an extended period of time is very draining and has its toll on me. When doing experiments I have a max 6 h of focus before I start burning out and getting anxious. I can work for longer but I have to constantly switch what I am doing throughout that period so my anxiety doesnt get out of hand.   Reading papers can be very difficult and again depends if I really am interested in what I am reading. Writing is not too difficult but getting myself to start writing is the most difficult and once I get past that, it's  smooth sailing.  Hopefully I am able to get a prescription in mid may."

    "sft_question": "Question: Engineering students who graduated with a low gpa(<3.0), how did you manage to find job opportunities?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "DON'T PUT IT ON YOUR RESUME! Don't lie about it if asked, but definitely don't advertise it.  I graduated with a 2.8. I didn't have any internships or co-ops either. On my resume, I highlighted my CAD skills, capstone project, and all the lab courses I had done in place of experience, since I had none. Took me 6 months after graduation, but I got a job.  A low GPA may make it impossible to get a job at a big company that hires hundreds of new grads every year (they'll often have a field for it on their online application and just automatically filter you out), but small companies need engineers too, and they're less likely to care about GPA."

    "sft_question": "Question: Explain like I'm five years old: How can the US power grid struggle with ACs in the summer, but be (allegedly) capable of charging millions of EVs once we all make the switch? Currently we are told the power grid struggles to handle the power load demand during the summer due to air conditioners. Yet scientists claim this same power grid could handle an entire nation of EVs. How? What am I missing?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "This is my career. I have worked for four major electric and gas utilities in the US. The answer to this question is there is not enough generation capacity at this current time. Each electric utility has a department called Resource Planning. They are responsible for what is called an “Integrated Resource Plan” which is filed usually every 1-3 years with the Public Utility Commission which is the State regulatory body overseeing the utility. In this resource plan they forecast demand for electric vehicles based on the current economic conditions, federal regulations, EV sales, etc. Based on this forecast, a department called Generation Modeling plans for how much generation is needed to meet this new demand. These resources can be new power plants as well as programs called demand side management where utilities give incentives to curb usage during peak times where the system is likely to brown/black out. These incentives can be based around rate design where the price is cheaper during off peak hours (10pm-5am). Or they can apply to large industrial customers that get a cheaper rate all the time but can have their service interrupted at times of peak demand.   TLDR: electric utilities are forecasting the demand for EV vehicles and are planning for this demand by either building new power plants or designing programs to reduce demand around peak hours."

    "sft_answer": "15+ years into my career and I think the two single classes that had the most influence on my career were the creative writing and public speaking classes I took as electives.  Unfortunately, there are many engineers who go through engineering school and don't get specfic training in these areas. Perhaps they have to write a lab report or present their project, but the focus is always on the engineering aspects and never on the quality of the writing or presentation.  All of your engineering knowledge can be worthless if you are unable to convey these ideas in a solid manner to others.  At the very least, not having these abilities will stop you from reaching the upper level positions at your firm.  I wrote an article about this on my LinkedIn profile that goes into this a bit deeper: Why technical knowledge is not the key to your success   Have a look and let me know what you think."

    "sft_answer": "The poster above me answered well, so I'll answer a slightly different way, if it helps.  Basically, if something has been shown a number of times and is starting to become an emerging observation or emerging knowledge in your subfield, then it is OK to just cite the review.  If you want to discuss a specific observation that the review mentions, you should cite the original paper rather than the review.  For example, I work in allergy, and I could easily say \"It has been shown that children who live on single-family farms are protected against allergy later in life\" and cite the review that lists all of the studies where people have shown that growing up on farms = less allergy.  If I want to say \"It has been shown that children who live on single-family Amish farms are protected against allergy compared to Hutterite children who live on large-scale industrial farms, even though they have a very similar diet and genetic background\" I should go and cite the original paper (even if learned this fun fact from the review) because it was a very specific observation from a limited set of studies."

They just want to feel like oppressed victims. There I said it. As a man myself, I find this crap both sad and pathetic. This ain’t about morality or the right thing and most of the men up in arms over it are doing so because this is a chance to use the case as a cudgel to shut women up from speaking out about legitimate and valid issues they face in society *from men*. Be it lower pay, sexism, harassment, domestic abuse, stalking, or sexual assault.   A lot of men hear that and, rather then reflect on the issues women have brought forward, default to *”nOT AlL mEN”* or in this case *”MEn sUfFEr ToO!”*. Johnny depp isn’t the martyr men on this website make him out to be. He’s a screwed up, spoiled, crazy rich guy who entered into a toxic relationship with an equally crazy woman and they brought out the worst in each other.   Good lord, check out the witness testimony from Depp’s own former associates or friends. He was doing coke the night before taking his daughter to school.

What men tend to point out is the assumption of total guilt and total innocence in the court of public opinion based on gender is *really dangerous* and in opposition to like basic principals of Justice.  Obviously Depp isn’t a saint, and it’s rather highly probable that they’re both kinda fucked up - and it’s mostly right for us to kinda tune it out and let it run its course in court before drawing conclusions beyond that."

I recently posted a comment regarding the difference between faith in religion and the \"faith\" in atheism. A lot of my reasoning against this lies in the fact that science manifests in reality. I dont think I have heard any arguments that give concrete examples of manifestations of religion in reality, apart from maybe stating that is where our morals come from (and even that is quite contentious I believe).

Please see my comment below regarding my belief of why Atheism is not based in faith:    >The biggest difference between religion and atheism is most atheists would say they believe in science and following the evidence.

I bet tons of people ask this question, however there is a specific reason(s) why I am wondering this.  I graduated right when Covid hit, during which time I was involved in research ( undergraduate level) that was then stopped because of the pandemic. So, my pilot research project never really had the ability to be seen all the way through.

I did participate in a dig and work-study, but that would only account for one letter of recommendation.  I’m wondering, after graduation, how do you ask for recommendation letters from professors whom you weren’t particularly close with?   I also had some complications and health issues after having my daughter, and wanted to wait until healthy again before applying to a graduate program, but now I feel uncomfortable asking for letters of recommendation.

Please help, Reddit.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "A man after my own heart. Fret no longer good sir!  If you're willing to go down a doughy hot pocket route, there are a ton of ways you can get a more effective result without the need to juggle dough cooking time with egg doneness.  1. Pita pocket style - Either using pita bread or a round roll, cut in half, slice or pull apart the soft bread part with your hands or knife, stuff in your fillings and enjoy 2. Hotdog style - slice a long roll down the side about 80% of the way through such that you still have a bread hinge and it opens like a book. Fill accordingly and enjoy. Not too much otherwise filling can squeeze out of top and ends. If you have to stuff it, scoop out some of the bread first. 3. Breakfast burrito style - just place into flatbread like tortilla and roll. If you're keeping ends open, wrap a little plastic wrap or foil just one one side (doesn't have to go all the way up) just to catch and runaway ingredients or juices 4. I must have an actual sandwich method - This one requires a little thinking with its construction. Moderation is the key. Better to have two sandwiches moderately filled than one mega one. My take would be to:    1. Toast insides of muffin/bread at the very least (outsides too if you want). Dryer bread helps with absorption.    2. If you want sauce on your sandwich, this is the very first thing you do after toasting. Either, top or bottom or both. I prefer side not with egg as the yolk is the \"sauce\" on that side. Don't use too much of it or shit slides around.    3. Sunny side up egg or eggs over easy (singular), pierce yolk so it starts running and cap with one slice of bread. Then flip with spatula so egg bleeds yolk into bread, which absorbs it. That slice of bread is the bottom biatch of the sandwich.    4. Next the meat. Add it on top of the egg. Not too thick of a layer or shit slides around.    5. Next cheese. If you wanted it melted, grill it first on the other slice of muffin/bread under broiler/grill. Otherwise, place on top of meat and close sandwich.    6. Let it all sit for a moment to allow bread to absorb juices. Then eat.  Finally, if you absolutely must do this all in a sealed ball of dough, use a poached or onsen egg (i.e. one where yolk is still runny) and have egg sit in the centre protected by a blanket of meat and cheese. Then deep fry that shit. Baking it will take too long and cook the egg too much in a closed setting. You can make it work in an open setting like with a tart with egg on top but you asked for closed sandwich, not open faced.  Hopefully one of those methods works for you, my man. Godspeed."

Today we were having our first open house, only to discover this morning a large sign in the bedroom window saying \"Proudly Hosting AirBNB, rent me via the App for your next party!\". The sign looks terrible, but the first question i got today from pretty much everyone was \"so your neighbour hosts on AirBnB?\", so it worked. Instead we got a single offer for a lot less than what most places around here go for according to our agent.  I am tired of this shit, and i am at wits end here. I loved this house, and both me and my wife wanted to start a family here. But now that Guy moved in with his rental company we can't live here anymore. Do i really have any sort of recourse here?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "If he is advertising it as a party rental, then he has changed the townhome from short-term accommodations to a commercial space. Zoning may not work in his favour on this. Furthermore this may require a liquor license which he may not have. A couple things to look into.  I might also try posing as a potential renter on Airbnb and ask for a copy of his insurance for the place. The insurers might not be aware that he is using it as a party rental place and allowing alcohol serving and consumption."

I was at work today and my boss, the head engineer, and I were having a discussion about this topic. I currently have some software I was lucky enough to get through my university (legally through an academic license). My boss asked me to do a 3D model of a product for a customer so we could send them drawings for approval. I respectfully declined and the the argument began. I explained to him that I got this software for free and for me to do this for him would be looked at as illegal. I explained to him that the software I have was worth around $3,500 for the most basic package and that the features can make it worth as much as $15,000 per license. His argument was that I was technically using it for academic use. He viewed it as real world practice. I held my ground and apologized and told him I didn't feel comfortable using my software.

    "sft_answer": "Imagine that all cars, freight ships, trucks, and airplanes would move at light speed. Now think about how long it would take to send a package around the world. Of course it would be faster now, but it wouldn't come close to the speed of light. _Moving the package_ would take almost no time, but the package would still spend a significant amount of time being inspected, loaded, unloaded, etc...  This is essentially how the internet works, too. Many of the same words are used here as well: traffic, package, destination, route, ... The information _moves_ at light speed, but spends a lot of time being _routed_ or even queued. Just like you don't have a dedicated road to every person on earth, data packages have to manoeuvre through a network of shared connections.  Imagine you're a router in such a network and you receive a package labeled with the destination \"216.58.207.78\" and you're connected to five other routers. You're gonna have think about where to send this for a bit unless you would want to send it to all of your router friends, which would make the internet wildly inefficient.  On top of that, as several people already pointed out: When looking at the scale of the earth the speed of light suddenly becomes significant. Going from Los Angeles to Berlin at light speed will take 31ms. Go back and forth (that's what a ping does) and you're at 62ms. That's already enough to ruin most online games. The overhead from routing roughly doubles the travel time, so in practice you would be working with a ping of around 124ms, which will make the game feel like you're wearing oven mitts.  EDIT: As /u/HakushiBestShaman pointed out, the information doesn't actually travel through the cabel at light speed, but quite a bit slower at around two-thirds light speed. Taking that into account it seems that the overhead from routing is quite low for long distances along _common_ routes, e.g. US<->EU."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: anything can and should be joked about in the right context I believe that, in the right context, anything can and should be joked about. To say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things. For example, joking about the Holocaust, while not always situationally appropriate, helps us process the tragedy and reinforces that we won and that we aren’t letting Nazis hold that power over us any more. To say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us, while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to Nazis and Hitler. Essentially, making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics.   Now, I’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics. Don’t make Holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they’re okay with it. Don’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they’re okay with it.  However, if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic, then joke away. In that case, the offended party is in the wrong.   Tl;dr: as long as there’s either nobody with a personal connection to a serious topic or those with the connection give the okay, anything can be joked about. Telling jokes about serious topics helps us cope and takes away the negative power of those topics.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I had a comedian friend tell me once that you can joke about anything, as long as you're not joking about *victims*. A rape joke could theoretically be funny. Joking about someone being raped or who has been raped? Not funny at all, because you're essentially making light of someone's suffering that they likely don't take lightly at all. Of course we're all different and there are exceptions.  For example Pete Davidson (SNL) used to tell a joke about how he didn't care when his mother told him his firefighter father died in 9/11 because he was seven and she got him a PS3 right after. I think that's a funny concept, because he's joking about his *own* tragedy. Not someone else's. In that context I think it's perfectly fine. However, if you or I were to joke about his father passing, that would likely upset him because we're trivializing someone else's suffering to get laughs about a situation that we didn't experience the pain of firsthand."

Take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a \"pop\" from a single point on the surface.

Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.  For simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:  - Perfectly spherical - Evenly distributed surface - No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium) - \"Pop\" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface  It seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping.

We have seen some absolutely amazing gastronomic discussions here, and hope you continue to provide the community with such helpful and thoughtful conversations.  With the rate of growth we have had the past few months, we feel it is necessary to make a few changes, reiterate some points and get the communities feedback on a few issues. The goal of these potential changes is to provide everyone with a better experience in our community. **We want to hear all of your feedback on these issues.**  Our main concern is about some of the questions that are being submitted.  * **Recipe based question**s - If you refer to our current rule #5 located in our sidebar, you can see that not every recipe based question is encouraged here. **We are not Google.** If you simply need ideas for a piece of meat, or want to know a great pie recipe, you will most likely get many great answers through google, or even other sub reddits. /r/cooking, /r/food or /r/recipes are all options. However, we understand there are some recipe based questions that are more uncommon, and harder to find legit answers, and in that case, you may post here. Think of /r/askculinary as the last resort. Questions like [this, this and this are not desirable here. Questions like this and this are fine however. Notice the difference in the quality of the question. The OP provides much more background and information in the posts that are well written. The more specific you can make a recipe/ingredient based question, the better.  * **Discussion based questions** - This sub reddit and community was created to help people become a better cook, and to increase your culinary knowledge. If a post has little to do with cooking, and would not help others with the answers, we feel this is not accomplishing our original goal. Questions like these three(#1, #2, #3) are not very appropriate here. Perhaps /r/KitchenConfidential is better. That being said, posts like this and this, are completely fine. Basically, if the answers to the question being asked would help the community in their culinary adventures, it is fine. **If it is just to share war stories and what not, we feel these do not fit in here.**  * **Question and comment formatting** - **With every question you ask, please be sure to give as much detail as possible.** The more detail you can give us, the better we can help you. Conversely, the more through you can be in your responses and comments, the better. Try to avoid those one or two word comments, make it as thorough as you can. We are aware that this is not always possible or necessary, but try and make your posts as thoughtful as possible. Good post, not so good post. Great post, not so great post.  * **Reposting, search function and FAQ** - **Please utilize the search function, and our FAQ before posting.** There are quite a bit of posts made that are extremely similar to each other that could be easily answered without reposting. We are in the works of possibly updating our FAQ, as well as updating some CSS coding. This will be done to remind the community of what is appropriate and give them some helpful resources.  This about sums up all of our ideas and issues that have been expressed by ourselves, and the community. **So I ask you r/askculinary, what are your thoughts on these issues?

I've had a colonoscopy (without pain relief) where they took biopsies. The doctors said the biopsies wouldn't hurt because the colon couldn't feel pain, and they were indeed painless. The amount of air they pumped in was horrifically painful however.   Trapped gas sounds trivial, but can also be extremely painful. Ulcerative colitis also hurts. So does diarrhoea.   So how do these pain mechanisms work? What causes the pain, if the interior of the colon is unfeeling?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "A simple way to think of the colon and pain is to relate it to the skin. Lots of different things can cause different types of pain in the skin. There's pressure, heat, cold, cuts and probably a few more. There is a specific type of nerve ending to sense each type of pain.  The colon (the entire intestine, in fact) has only two types of pain receptors - ones that sense stretching, and ones that sense lack of oxygen (which happens when the colon is starved of blood). Trapped gas will make the colon wider, which sets off the stretching pain receptors. Biopsies don't hurt because the colon lacks the nerve endings to sense cuts and bruises."

Hi everyone, I am currently finishing my master's in electrical engineering am trying to think of what type of PhD I want and what sort of cool things I could maybe do with it. For my undergraduate I double majored in both electrical and mechanical engineering and minored in computer science. Then I started my MSEE and am considering many different areas for a PhD.

After working for several years with a BS I went back to get a MS because the coolest work was done by people with advanced degrees, and honestly, it should be because I was not prepared for those roles. Then after working for several more years in a more analytical position with the MS I again noticed this difference when you look at what PhD's are doing.  So now I am just starting my PhD.  Don't let anyone tell you how their work experience trumps your education, or how work experience is more important, or how you can learn everything on the job.  Those are people trying to rationalize their decisions in life.  There IS a massive difference that I can attest to having been in EVERY position from bottom up so far.  Besides that rant, semiconductor industry is hot and while working there they couldn't get enough PhD's from electrical, mechatronics, and computer engineering.

    "sft_answer": "there are plenty of ELI5s that discuss the basics of electrical flow and how a formed circuit is required to conduct electricity through a device, so by unplugging it you are breaking the circuit between the common and hot prongs and removing the path for electricity to flow- but I'm guessing this isn't what you are really asking...  assuming you are asking about the energy that was traveling through the cable at the time it was disconnected, it pretty much stays there as static charge (capacitance) as long as nothing is draining it from the other side, with the amount of charge left based on the cable properties (thickness, conductance, etc) and the voltage that was driving the current flow. things that could drain the static charge on the other end include transformers, power regulators, or based on the way the source unit is grounded. in heavy power transmission lines, this is typically called \"residual power\" and can be very dangerous, though it has more to do with the actual capacitors involved and less-so the capacitance of the cables."

    "sft_answer": "Most people who grew up in \"rice loving\" homes or regions know that rice must be rinsed of starch before cooking.  For them it is as obvious as the need to peel an onion before using it.  So depending on who is replying to these questions, you may see nothing about rinsing the rice (because they naturally assumed it would be done), you may see an off hand \"rinse the rice\" without a real description of what that means, or in rare cases you might see gringo directions like this - rinse the rice in a cup or bowl in tap water by stirring it then pouring off the cloudy water - do this as often as necessary until the water is no longer cloudy (likely 10+ times).  This is the key secret to any rice - sushi, basmati, pilaf, even sticky Thai."

    "sft_question": "Question: I rear ended someone a year ago, and they are suing me for $750,000. TN. On December 14th, 2021, I was coming up over a hill, and as I got to the top of the hill, a line of cars were braking suddenly… and I rear ended someone. I didn’t have enough time to stop due to not being able to see the brake lights as I was approaching/coming up over the hill.   I asked the guy if he was ok and apologized at least a million times. He said yes, and when the police asked if he needed medical assistance, he said no. He did mention to me that he has had back surgery before. The guy in front of the guy I rear ended also pulled over and told the police that he witnessed me coming over the hill and told them I didn’t have enough time to brake.   I just got papers that I’m being summoned to court, and the guy is suing for $750,000.   I literally have no idea what to do… I called my insurance today, and my rep wasn’t in office today.

Also wanted to mention that once the attorney working with your insurance company is involved, you’ll likely have to be in contact with them to get questions answered (interrogatories) and get info about depositions, mediations and court dates (if it gets there). Not saying that to scare you, but just saying that this will involve some effort on your part, but the attorney will guide you the entire time.

I've been taking him to the vet for months now.  6 1/2 year old border collie mix. We live in southern Wisconsin. He has two perfectly healthy doggie siblings.  He started last October with just not being his happy hungry self, so vet expressed his anal glands.  He continued to not eat much, appetite comes and goes. He started to yelp when we would pet him, but every few days the spot with pain would change.  He had stool and urine samples, blood tests, x-ray and ultrasound. Nothing conclusive. Sometimes protein levels would be high, sometimes they weren't. Sometimes he had bacteria, sometimes he didn't.  He started getting open sores, crusty spots, fur falling in clumps, random lumps under his skin. Some seemed to be by his lymph nodes, one was along his spine.  He is NOT itching, and only occasionally does some licking. Scrapings taken from spots and biopsy of lumps. No mites, no obvious reason for the sores and scabs. Biopsy inconclusive. They couldn't rule out lymphoma, but there was nothing strongly indicating it.  He does have a low grade fever and high white blood cell count.  There are new sores popping up on a daily basis. I'm currently waiting on results from \"better\" tests.  We've done two kinds of antibiotics with no improvement. Other than that, pain pills that don't really seem to help.

I have an undergrad degree in French, and I’ve bounced around in ideas, thinking about getting a grad degree in Linguistics, social work, French, TESOL, on and on. The main issue for me is passion vs financial security. The things that would give me the most job options are uninteresting to me, and the things that do interest me…not a lot of career options. It’s not that I need to make a lot of money, to be clear. It’s the fear that I’ll get the degree and not be able to support myself at a minimum and pay off my debt, if I can’t find a job.   Philosophy seems like the worst fit for this! It’s not a versatile degree! But it’s the most interesting to me. I know I love language, and I think studying philosophy of language would be fascinating. My mind works very abstractly, I love the theoretical and abstract, and I love living an examined life. I think it might be the perfect fit.   When I think about what I would think about my life when I’m nearing my end, I don’t want to think, “man, I paid off that debt fast. I really bought a lot of good stuff, too.” I want to think, “I tried to understand. I didn’t go blindly through this life. I didn’t focus just on the money.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The DSM can be more harmful than helpful and it's overused Now, to make it clear, I'm not saying mental illnesses aren't real and that diagnosing people with them is pointless. But, the culture surrounding it, both inside clinical settings and on the internet, doesn't help people. It creates a culture of diagnosis, over actually helping people. It treats mental illness in a very medicalized way, when mental and physical illnesses shouldn't be viewed in the same way. They should be viewed with the same amount of respect. On the internet, specifically amongst teenagers, but not always, it becomes diagnosis olympics. I fell into this trap as a teenager, of becoming fascinated by what I could potentially have, as well as mental illnesses in general. Nothing wrong with that, looking into the mind is fascinating, but looking into it through that lens can lead to problems. It's not even people self-diagnosing that's necessarily the issue, cause sometimes people just know themselves, but rather viewing the mental illness as the explanation to all their problems. People behave as if these labels came before their actual experiences, when it's the opposite. Nothing really changes when you get diagnosed, people just feel comforted by it, because it is human nature to want to categorize things. I think a diagnosis can be helpful in understanding how to treat someone, and give them context into what's going on, but it's not the full picture by any means. In psychiatric hospitals, this is especially an issue, in which diagnosing people becomes the priority over actually helping them, so that people can be given meds, then sent away, since there's not enough space, and everyone is emotionally burnout (I know, that's a simplified view of what's going on).\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I suffer from severe mental health conditions related to my military service and traumatic head injuries.  Some respond to pharmaceuticals. Some don't. All require other types of therapeutic management.  A diagnosis is a requirement for treatment. That's just how medicine works. That treatment can be a prescription for exercise and diet, or it can be a prescription for pharmaceuticals, or it can be a referral to a therapist, or it can be something like invasive surgery. But, there has to be an underlying REASON for WHY a physician is recommending a treatment protocol.  That reason can't be \"Well, it just seems like something to do.\"  Here's the important bit that only a few psychiatrists will share (mine happens to be one of them), good psychiatrists know that the diagnostic categories are just a gateway to treatment. They really don't mean much of anything and good doctors don't really pay much attention to the labels. They pay attention to how well patients respond to treatment. And they adjust treatment using signs and symptoms to guide them, not the DSM.  All it really functions as is a starting point for entering into a treatment protocol. And, after a lengthy period of time and refinement, maybe it can be a landing place if it matters to a patient what their condition is labeled.     People who aren't trained diagnosticians using the DSM are rightly thought of with about the same level of respect as monkey's using a graphing calculator.  They may be having fun, but whatever they are doing, it isn't using the tool appropriately."

    "sft_answer": "I believe it is an inaccurate statement.  They are misapplying the Landauer Limit which states the theoretical minimum entropy change (and thus energy required) to change a bit of information.  Since energy equates to mass (e=mc\\^2), you can frame this energy as mass.  In fact, if you take the value from the wikipedia article (2.805 zeptoJoules) and run it through e=mc\\^2, you wind up with 31 quectograms, which is I'm sure where they got the value in the article.  However- this is a theoretical minimum amount of energy (which would be converted to heat) needed to change a bit of information in a perfectly efficient computer.  So wrong for two reasons:  1) Your mobile phone is not nearly this efficient.  By many, many orders of magnitude.   2) It does not change the mass of the computing device.  The energy came in a low-entropy form from a battery, and converts to a high-entropy form as heat.  The energy is neither created nor destroyed, the mass of the device does not change (until that heat is radiated away, which is a completely separate issue).  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s\\_principle"

Step 1 is to save up chicken bones ( carcass, neck, meat litterally anything) then you wanna wash them until your water runs crystal clear. After that throw in some onion rosemary sage thyme celery carrots shallots pepper corns bayleaves and whatever else you wanna try experiment its alot of fun! Put all of these is a cheese cloth tied to your pot for easy removal later. Then you wanna heat the water up to a simmer and skim whatever gunk comes to the surface with a spoon or mesh. After like 2 hours you shouldn't have to worry about it but for those 2 hours check up on it and skim it every 20 mins or so. After that just let it go i usually do overnight but 6-8 hours is usually fine just check it make sure the water hasnt evaporated away too much but no need to babysit it ( i litterally leave the building  for the night tho i use a steam kettle so no fire hazard there do what you feel is safe) then you gotta strain it out now is also the time to portion if you want. I use a mesh strainer and cheese cloth the finer the better. Be sure to go SLOW there is a layer of fat at the top and that is good stuff but not for the stock so you have 2 options. 1 you can stop straining when you see fat bubbles and set the fat aside for later use. 2 you can strain the whole thing then let cool in fridge and the fat will become solid and you can pull it iff the top like a stick of butter. Finally add some salt if you want and bam you got that good clear chicken stock that will make your whole house smell like bomb ass chicken noodle soup"

Your knowledge will come with time, but it should never be a problem to double check with someone on something you may be unsure about. It is ALWAYS better to ask and double check than to assume and get complacent, that is how accidents happen and animals get hurt.  No one expects you to know everything nor remember everything, especially if you're just starting. There is so much information to learn and clinics do things differently and doctors prefer certain things. Keep a notebook like others have said and have an open mind and you'll do great."

With the recent discovery of Omicron and it’s apparent rapid transmission and positive identification across the globe, how do current COVID tests determine which variant is being detected as present? Which tests have this capability? I have only ever seen tests that detect the presence of a coronavirus, but not the exact variant.   If the Omicron variant was just discovered days ago in South Africa, how would tests already in use in Europe, USA and Asia be able to not only detect the presence of  but also positively determine which variant was detected, especially when that variant was not known to exist until this week?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "This thread has a lot of misinformation, so I need to clear things up a little.  In abstract it is generally hard to identify new variants of a virus, as you need to sequence the entire genome and look for changes vs sequences of that virus in a reference database (and then decide if the changes are meaningful for viral efficacy).  That is expensive and relatively slow, so you don't do it for every viral sample you collect.  When you do \"rapid tests\" like antigen or PCR tests, you are using some smart technology that flags up when a subsequence of proteins (antigen) or RNA (PCR) has been found in a sample (so the trick in making one of these tests is to find a protein or RNA sequence that is unique to the virus and consistently present in the virus)  Therefore, **the vast majority of the time, a rapid test gets exactly the same result regardless of variant and therefore we only know that you have COVID, not what kind of COVID you have**.  **However, Omicron is a special case** and it has a LOT of new mutations.  To get into the weeds a little bit, the predominant PCR test looks for three distinct RNA sequences to identify COVID and one of those three sequences is mutated in Omicron.  (Extra detail: the mutated bit is called S-gene and this error is SGTF, S-Gene Transcription Failure).  Therefore **Omicron has a unique signature in COVID PCR tests**, where you will test positive for two-of-three COVID RNA marker.  Therefore we can track Omicron very well with PCR tests."

    "sft_question": "Question: [MCU/Marvel] Why do superheroes not collaborate more/share resources in the marvel universe? I've been thinking about this alot especially as a big fan of the marvel movies. Why do the superheroes not share resources/technology or aid more with one another in the marvel universe? I want to be clear i absolutely love these movies and these characters but they seem to constantly go \"lone wolf\" and put themselves or their mission in danger when it is completely unnecessary. Even if it meant waiting to resolve the situation until help could arrive to ensure the best possible outcome  For example in Spiderman- No Way Home, Peter Parker struggles tremendously against the villains in that film and it costs him his aunt may and nearly MJ. He did at one point have the help of Dr. Strange but in fairness they had a disagreement on the proper resolution to the situation so i will allow that. Why didn't Peter make a phone call or send an Avengers SOS to Sam Wilson, Hulk, Hawkeye, Antman or any of the thousands of people that showed up in the Endgame battle? He did have the help of the other spidermen but at that point he had already lost his aunt. In Endgame we see that the heroes were able to regroup and rally into a large fighting force really quickly if the situation demands it. The multiverse was literally tearing itself apart. In Falcon and the Winter soldier we see that  Sam as the new Captain America had a pretty good handle on the situation but why not call Spider-man or Hulk for back up just in case? He clearly had to travel the long distance from Louisiana to New York, why not make a quick phone call to ask Avengers that might be nearby for help if they are available? If it meant saving more lives why not? Sam and Bucky are both military veterans and should know better than anyone the value of having a solid team and backup in any situation, regardless of how good of a handle you think you have on the situation.  Secondly, why dont the Avengers share technology and resources. We see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier that Sam is in dire financial straits due to the Avengers not actually paying him. Why is this? Even as an informal group why wouldn't Tony fund the group with paychecks and equipment? We see in Age of Ultron that he reformatted Stark tower into a makeshift base of operations. Why not make the Avengers unofficial stark employees so they could be compensated for their time? Peter seems to be the only one that received some manner of compensation in the form of a scholarship and a suit.  With regard to equipment i dont understand why Tony didn't give everyone a mini upgrade to their equipment. Spiderman receives an excellent nanotech suit but why didn't he give Captain America a suit that gives him a strength or speed boost? Hawkeye and Black Widow are incredibly skilled but a basic set of nanotech body armor, even without any bells and whistles would keep them much safer and maybe add a few additional tricks into their arsenal. I dont see why they would turn it down out of \"personal preference\" if it meant it an emergency situation that it might mean the difference between life and death for civilians or themselves. Quicksilver might've been saved incredibly easily if he was wearing a pretty basic Stark tech level set of body armor. Or Hawkeye could've saved himself if he had that shield generator that stark used in Endgame.  &#x200B;  For clarification im not saying the full might of the Avengers was necessary for every mugger and car crash. But for the big stuff... why dont they ask each other for help?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In the MCU it's really a matter of lack of organization, because what you're describing is definitely the *idea*. They've simply never been able to integrate themselves anywhere well enough that this sort of thing is feasible. Most of their attempts either failed or proved massively unpopular.  Say the Iron Legion-- they were created specifically to help with rescue operations and make sure Avengers missions didn't fuck up civilians *too* much, but they became a symbol of American imperialism. Iron Man's big dumb billion dollar-army coming to any country and telling civilians to leave their house, because they're about to be destroyed. And *then* one of them turned into Ultron, it just didn't work.  In-land, you're actually not allowed to just citizen arrest a bank robber after beating the shit out of him. That's the police's job. If Iron Man wanted to help out the police, he'd have to be on their payroll, play by their rules, and file paperwork, as well as be accountable for any property damage his missions caused.   While there can be a gentleman's agreement that Iron Man is a concerned citizen that is here to help out the police make an arrest,  this becomes harder to justify as more and more supervillains seem to very specifically target heroes that have wronged them in the past.   All of this not to mention that the one governmental organ that was supposed to middleman this exact problem, SHIELD, turned out to be literal WW2 fascists waiting for their chance to strike. Anything that required paperwork or someone looking over the legalese of their situations is now impossible to get going, and any operations larger than some heroes literally hanging out and agreeing on what to do stopped being the case.   Ultimately, it's just hard to organize all over again, especially after the Snap. It's probably going to happen *eventually*, especially as the next generation rises up and natural leaders rally heroes behind them again. But until then, heroes are basically free agents breaking the law, because no one will represent them as a non-governmental organization anymore."

One of the most popular selections is the Cremeschnitte. Others unfortunately don't have a wikipedia page but this picture gives an idea of what a regular spread looks like. Except ours is way bigger. Mom doesn't fuck around.     The traditional Christmas meat in Croatia is turkey. We did turkey until we moved to the US at which point everybody got all turkeyed out but the time thanksgiving was over so now we do goose. The most important (because tastiest) part of the whole thing is called Mlinci . It's pasta sheets rolled out very thin and cooked on a griddle or dry pan until they look like tortillas. They are then broken into bite sized pieces and boiled. In the last 20 minutes or so you lift the goose, reserve most of the rendered fat, toss the mlinci in the drippings then lay the bird back on. I'm not joking when I say they're better than the meat itself."

Gross post warning  I'm not sure if it's even in the law that it's illegal because \"animals can't consent,\" but I often hear people say that's why it's wrong. But it seems a little ridiculous to claim animals can't consent.  Here's an example. Let's say a silverback gorilla forces a human to have sex with it, against the human's will. The gorilla rapes the human. But what happens if suddenly, the human changes their mind and consents. Is the human suddenly raping the gorilla, because the gorilla cannot consent? If the human came back a week later and the same event occured, but the human consents at the begining this time, did the human rape the gorilla?   I think beastiality should be illegal ONLY because it disgusts me, as ridiculous as that sounds. No ethical or moral basis to it. And to protect animals from *actually* getting raped by humans, which certainly happens unfortunately.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "So the best argument I've figured for this goes like this:  Yes, an animal can indicate that it wants sex, but so can a teenager (13+). The reason we don't allow that is both kids and animals don't have the tools to escape abusive relationships, and any relationship with a human adult is by nature going to have a massive power dynamic.  There are some flaws in this argument. One is that larger animals (cows, horses) would probably be able to beat the shit out of a human if given the motivation and chance. However dogs especially are unlikely to use force even in that situation   I also suspect that most people do dislike it on gut feeling, that's disgusting, sanitation type grounds"

    "sft_question": "Question: Do you feel that the skilled trades as a career path is undervalued/underappreciated concerning today youth? Hey guys, as an engineer that has worked at a variety of manufacturing companies, I have noticed how great of a life/satisfying it can be to work as a skilled tradesman. However, I can't help but to see a stigma attached to it when concerning the youth of today and their parents.  In this day in age, I find that more and more kids that are interested in technical work are pushed to go into university for any STEM field while the \"dummies\" are left to go to college and become tradesmen.  Just talking to peers, I find that the overall perception of tradesmen are the electricians that hook up your electricity to your house, plumbers, HVAC guys and mechanics that work at small shops. \"Joe\" jobs.  I find it frustrating that they don't understand that many of these tradesmen are extremely technically competent and can work on amazing projects like plane, ship and mining/manufacturing tooling construction for the top tier companies in the world (boeing, apple, catapiller). Most I have seen get paid more than engineers (some upwards of 200k) and can transfer into management as well.  I have worked before in Germany (I'm Canadian) and have noticed that the tradesmen are much more appreciated there than in north america.  This frustrates me because there is a huge demand for tradesmen while I am starting to see more and more young engineering graduates struggle to get jobs. I feel that the current schooling system puts a huge negative bias towards the trades.  Thoughts?\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The DSM can be more harmful than helpful and it's overused Now, to make it clear, I'm not saying mental illnesses aren't real and that diagnosing people with them is pointless. But, the culture surrounding it, both inside clinical settings and on the internet, doesn't help people. It creates a culture of diagnosis, over actually helping people. It treats mental illness in a very medicalized way, when mental and physical illnesses shouldn't be viewed in the same way. They should be viewed with the same amount of respect. On the internet, specifically amongst teenagers, but not always, it becomes diagnosis olympics. I fell into this trap as a teenager, of becoming fascinated by what I could potentially have, as well as mental illnesses in general. Nothing wrong with that, looking into the mind is fascinating, but looking into it through that lens can lead to problems. It's not even people self-diagnosing that's necessarily the issue, cause sometimes people just know themselves, but rather viewing the mental illness as the explanation to all their problems. People behave as if these labels came before their actual experiences, when it's the opposite. Nothing really changes when you get diagnosed, people just feel comforted by it, because it is human nature to want to categorize things. I think a diagnosis can be helpful in understanding how to treat someone, and give them context into what's going on, but it's not the full picture by any means. In psychiatric hospitals, this is especially an issue, in which diagnosing people becomes the priority over actually helping them, so that people can be given meds, then sent away, since there's not enough space, and everyone is emotionally burnout (I know, that's a simplified view of what's going on).\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "How are we supposed to diagnose mental illness then? Vibes? A oujia board?   Mental and physical illnesses are both illnesses and both require specific, detailed, scientific diagnostic criteria.   A book doesn’t create the culture you talk about and based on the fact people fake physical illnesses too, you can’t get rid of it. If we treated mental and physical illnesses more similarly with treatment plans, the understanding of friends, family, and employers when time off or specific things are needed, and it’s seen as a legit roadblock instead of something you just get over, the culture will get better. Removal of the DSM will only further invalidate the existence of mental illness and hinder people seeing help because it would become more subjective which is BAD for consistency and accuracy of treatment."

So I recently came across some interesting controversy regarding a certain celebrity speaking in a way some may refer to as a blaccent (black accent). In this particular case it’s very clear the person wasn’t mocking or demeaning in any way, and it seemingly was just the way they spoke most of the time. However I noticed that a significant number of people find this way of speaking to be offensive when the speaker isn’t black. They called it Cultural Appropriation. A term that has gained more and more traction in the last decade. Some think this act of Cultural Appropriation is a sin ranging from insensitive ignorance to straight up racism.   This is just an inevitable part of the human experience. Cultural Appropriation just a sign your culture is succeeding  If someone or some groups are respectfully trying to emulate your culture or aspects of it, wouldn’t that be a good thing? This is provided that it’s done in a respectful way (I am in no way speaking of someone mocking cultural practices). Culture and language are living things with a constant exchange between different groups. This is how cultures survive, spread, and possibly dominate.   There are many ways a culture can spread but in the case of black culture in America I think we can all agree it’s succeeding because of its cool factor. Everything from gospel and blues inspiring rock and roll to current hip hop and RnB are linked to black culture.   So my question to everyone is: Do you think cultural appropriation is bad?

    "sft_question": "Question: [Star Wars] Why are the Separatists and their droid army so feared? It seems like they lose most, if not all, of the battles the Republic engages them in Even their top general, General Grievous, seems to be extremely incompetent in military strategy, with him being beat back at almost every turn. Also, their droids are incredibly inaccurate for robots that have a built in aiming system.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The Separatists are feared for several reasons:  The Republic can't give them a knock-out punch, they keep hanging on battle after battle. People are afraid of any rogue army that takes wild chances, will kill off tens of thousands of troops for no reason, and will brutalize anyone who resists. And the Separatists will always recover after every battle because they can just build more droids. And yet people see their Jedi protectors get fewer and fewer...and Grievous and Dooku are hella scary on their own.      In more detail:      First of all you have to realize Palpatine was not running a conventional war. He was both sides. If one side won, Palpatine *lost*.  Palpatine's goal was to prolong the war (and destabilize the republic enough to gain control) and kill Jedi. Once Palpatine achieved both goals (emergency powers + Order 66) the war was over and it was down to mopping things up. So Grievous had to keep the war burning and kill Jedi and he was great at both.     Who doesn't matter: The clones take time to replace but are essentially irrelevant to the war effort. They are team Palpatine either way so killing them is kind of irrelevant to Palpatine. (and Grievous, whether he knew it or not)      Jedi are who Palpatine *hates.* They stand in the way of his success and he can't fight them all and he could never train enough apprentices to tackle them head-on. Every single Jedi who lives is a big threat to his plans and his personal safety. Luckily there is a very, *very* limited number of Jedi. Force-users are one in a billion, require a lifetime to train to make them effective, have to be constantly retrained to prevent dark-side drift, and each one is essentially irreplaceable. Palpatine will never train enough apprentices to tackle the Jedi head-on. The only way to fight them is to divide them, stoke their inner conflicts, put innocent lives in danger so they take stupid risks, and focus so many blaster bolts at them that they cannot deflect them all and attrition wears them away.      The Separatists (who noticeably have a lot of business/industrial interests) are a custom designed foil for the Jedi with their nearly infinite number of droids. Droids are cheap, suicidally brave even against space-wizards with laser-swords, can be made nearly anywhere on an assembly line, and can fire a blaster. General Grievous can lose a ten-thousand cheap droids and retreat in a battle but along the way if he nails even *one* Jedi than he's doing great! And Palpatine would think that battle was great trade! In this way Grievous could lose every single battle, still remain in the fight and then *win* by steadily thinning out the Jedi.      During any of prequels or associated media do you ever hear about Palpatine complaining \"Grievous you've killed a Jedi but all those droids cost money buddy. We've got a budget you know.\" Nope. Let it rain (droids), nobody cares! As mentioned Palpatine orchestrated the war for those two simple reasons: Cause turmoil with a prolonged conflict so he could seize power, and kill all dem Jedi. The Separatists, Dooku, and Grievous got the job done."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Trump could go back on almost all of his campaign promises and still retain the support of most of his supporters Before the election, many Trump supporters said that they supported him for his policies not his personality. I don't think that is true. Since the election, he seems to have struggled to get anything done even with about as favourable a situation a President could have.  He's argued for healthcare changes that takes insurance away from people despite promising to do the opposite. He's gotten the US more involved in Syria despite promising the opposite. He has claimed credit for keeping jobs in the US that were never going to leave and creating jobs that were already planned. He decided the low unemployment figures were real when he won the election. He claimed to \"drain the swamp\" then gave his family important jobs. He said Obama was wrong to use executive orders then did so. He still seems to be trusted by his supporters. Likewise, when he argued that Obama wiretapped him, I thought that Trump supporters would find a way to believe him. They did.  I think that Trump could do the exact same things as Obama and effectively do no actual work but as long as he offends the left and minorities, he will retain the support of >80% of his current supporters as the media they watch and their own bias will convince them that everything is getting better and Trump is doing a great job.

    "sft_answer": "Not an insignificant portion of Trump voters were also Obama voters.  This doesn't necessarily disprove your initial thesis that Trump supporters are basing their support for him off of something other than policy but I would argue that Trump and Obama were two very different people and represented two very different things. These voters clearly aren't supporting Trump just because he's a republican/conservative.   I would argue that Trump has been very inconsistent on just about everything except for two topics: Immigration and Economic Populism. A lot of rust belt/working class voters see these two issues as being their most important issues with gun rights being a close third.   To relate that to the previous statistic, Barack Obama won the rust part partially by using the same kind of rhetoric as Trump (although in his own unique way). He talked about China in the same way that Trump did, he talked a lot about keeping jobs in the country and attempting to keep them from moving overseas. Obama was also did a lot of deportation (although they didn't advertise that too much). Furthermore the Obama administration said almost nothing about guns until Sandy Hook which was well after re-election.   When we see these areas in which Obama and Trump overlapped with these voters I think we start to paint a picture of not \"personality\" based voters but rather issues based voters. It would seem things are single or double issue voters who could care less about the skeletons in your closet, your race, gender or whatever. I think they want to feel that somebody is speaking/fighting for them and that seems to mean tough talk on immigration and tough talk on free trade.  If Trump were unable to get anything done towards these objects or even reverse his position on any of them I argue you would see a significant slide in support from his core base of voters."

    "sft_question": "Question: If the EU is so focused on Euro emissions standards, why is there not more focus on truck design? So this is gonna sound like a bit of guesswork, and it is.  However as a truck driver, I full on believe that I can *feel* the extra resistance when driving a Cabover truck versus a bonneted truck.  Plus from my experience, our Bonnet trucks got better economy over our new Cabovers at work.  The old bonnet trucks did around 650km from 400l of Diesel, these were running Mack Engines designed in the 70's, so an economy of 61.54l/100km at 55 tonnes  The new trucks are a tad heavier, I've not had one past 60 tonnes, however we get down to 350km from 400l of Diesel, which comes to 114.29l/100km on some runs.  The new heavy transporter (low loader) can get, on a good day, 200l/100km and if terrain is bad, even less, but that's in excess of 100 tonnes.  However then you go across to companies that make bonnet trucks, so for example the drag co-efficient of a Tesla Semi is 0.35, most Bonnet trucks get around 0.5 and most Cabovers get as high as 0.9  So it makes me think if anyone knows how to reduce aerodynamic drag, it would be Tesla, so they clearly picked a bonnet truck for a reason.  Now, to me, even with the DPF and DEF and all the other emissions gear, the fact that our new trucks that are Euro 5 are chewing damn near double the fuel of our old trucks at a similar weight makes me wonder, is this Euro 5 Emissions stuff actually achieving anything?  Would Manufacturers possibly see better gains from making more aerodynamic bonnet trucks? I get that you might have to knock maybe 2-4 pallet spaces off a trailer to get the overall length to be the same, to remain under dimension limits, however if you're spending half the money on fuel, surely those savings could stack up over 1,000,000kms?  For reference, our Cabovers will chew 1,142,900 litres of fuel, the old truck would chew 615,400 litres, so a saving of 527,500 litres over the life of the truck, or at current Australian prices of $1.19/l that's around $627,725 AUD per truck, so a fleet of trucks us a massive fuel saving  So looking at a cost of $2.05/km on average to operate a truck in Australia, and an average 45ft trailer so for 26 pallets that's around $0.07884615/pallet/km  So freight of 1,500km as an average would be $118.27/pallet per trip  So if your average trip is 1,500km then you would get 666 trips out of your truck per million kilometres.  So that's $78,767.82 earned by that truck per pallet space, so removing 2 pallet spaces would lose $157,535.64 over the lifetime of the truck, 4 spaces would lose $315,071.28 so even losing 4 whole pallet spaces to run a bonnet truck to a Cabover would still net you a saving over the life of the truck of around $312,654 if the fuel savings I've observed hold true.  So yeah, it's got me wondering why Euro Emissions aren't calling for more efficient truck shapes, and instead seem to focus on engines and exhaust emissions?  Is there a practical reason why Cabovers are still preferred by European truck Manufacturers and why a lot of the trucks coming out now to Euro emissions standards, even from companies like Kenworth are pushing Cabovers, with the bonnet trucks being more focused on the heavy lifting (Like the T909 being aimed at Road Train work and the Mack Titan being targeted at Heavy Haulage) where economy and emissions aren't as much of a concern?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "You may be burning more fuel to go the same distance but the amount of harmful emissions in your exhaust will be less with a properly working system. You could burnt twice as much fuel to go the same distance but still only emit half the harmful emissions. It would be less efficient cost wise but not necessarily worse as far as emissions goes. Engine and exhaust system design have a larger impact on emissions because it is not typically measured as the amount of harmful emissions your vehicle produces but the rate at which your vehicle produces. The amount would change over the same distance if you drove significantly faster or had a lighter load. The rate let’s you know your emissions contribution per liter of fuel used regardless of engine speed, which gives a more universal metric to compare across different applications. I hope that makes sense."

    "sft_answer": "I've made this recipe before. I can't know for sure what went wrong, but these are my ideas.  Drying the tenderloin before doing anything to it helps prevent sogginess and the pastry falling apart.  Your duxelles may have not been dry enough.  You may have not added the right amount of mustard or coated well enough, the mustard and duxelles should add a layer of protection to the pastry if spread correctly, with dry enough duxelles, and a mustard that isn't liquidy.  Different tenderloins will take different amounts of time cooking, and the pastry will potentially be over cooked if your tenderloin is thick or you cook it to a higher temperature.  Those are my thoughts."

I'll preface with this: yes, gender equality would mean treating genders equally, so men shouldn't view women as weaker or treat them differently because of gender. So yeah, the whole \"you shouldn't fight a girl because she's a girl\" logic is inherently sexist. So I don't disagree with the fact that gender equality means throwing that whole idea out.  &#x200B;  However...  &#x200B;  If your very first thought is to use gender equality as a justification for violence against women, you're most likely misogynistic, or maybe you're just trying to crack a really annoying overused joke, idk. When I think of feminism, I think of equality in opportunities - in the eyes of the law, in healthcare, in sports, in the job market, in education, in STEM fields and so on; my very first thought isn't \"oOo so that means men should be allowed to hit girls!\" Like why are your thoughts on feminism immediately connected to what men can do because of feminism? Why is your first instinct violence against women instead of considering how much more positive women's lives can be as gender equality improves? Why is feminism seen as a justification for doing more wrong?   &#x200B;  Feminism should focus on lifting women up so that they are on equal footing as men and get the same treatment and opportunities as men get. So why are you immediately resorting to the new opportunities men can get as feminism develops? Also, yes you can theoretically fight women like you would men, but I feel like with the men who don't understand feminism well, they're going to take this as \"I'm allowed to hit women\" when in reality the notion should only apply to situations like fighting in self-defense. Some people are definitely going to take gender equality as \"men are \\*allowed\\* to fight women\" instead of \"men should not be held back from violence against any gender if they are in a situation of self-defense or where violence is necessary.\"   &#x200B;  Again, I agree that saying things like \"I don't fight women,\" \"I can't hit her because she's a girl,\" etc. are sexist; they are. But, if the first thing you think of when you think of gender equality is hitting women, out of all things that could change because of feminism...you got problems.  &#x200B;  Sorry in advance if any explanation was unclear, I kinda suck at writing out arguments.

    "sft_answer": "This might not make much sense but bare with me.  In my experience most men have experienced being assaulted by women, and they've been forced to just take it.   Equality in violence resonates in men's brains because it's the side of inequality that we've personally experienced.   When women think gender equality they think societal opportunity, bodily autonomy, fair wages etc. All the things they've been denied.  When men think gender equality they think equality of violence. Because that's the relevant inequality to many men.  So I don't think men say this in a sexist way, just a selfish way. Instead of listening to women's grievances they jump straight to \"what do I get out of it? No more swallowing violence from women.\""

    "sft_question": "Question: Multilingualism and monolingualism as cultures? I got into an argument recently that suggested to my mind that multilingualism and monolingualism may be cultures or have cultures surrounding them that produce different etiquettes and values in their speakers.  My thoughts were that monolingual cultures demand that multilingual speakers change their language use to accommodate monolingual speakers (including, say, when the latter are the minority in a conversation), and it is rude to 'exclude' monolinguals through language choice.  Whereas multilingual cultures demand that monolingual speakers do their best to fit in with multilingual conversations, and it is rude to demand that others change or limit their language choice to suit oneself.  Is there any substance to this whether in these terms or from a different angle? If so are there some interesting literatures to explore?  I realise there's a political aspect to this, for example attitudes towards and of English speakers both in English-speaking countries and non-English speaking countries. I'm not trying to ask a political or moral question though, nor am I trying to use this thread to score any points for either 'team', just genuinely curious about the wider anthropological dimension around some of these experiences.

I also grew up/live in a monolingual country but have lived in multilingual countries and am part of an extended family whose members split into three different first languages.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I mean what is the difference between multilingual and monolingual cultures, if not just the extent of tolerance? No culture on its own develops branching languages, unless separated for long periods of time, across large distance. It's not a natural phenomenon on societal scales. Individually you may want to learn multiple languages that's your prerogative.   If you want to talk about linguistic homogeneity or heterogeneity, that's a different thing. That refers to the extent of inclusivity and social harmony. Whichever party *demands* the other to adjust is less inclusive, more prideful, more entitled. If both parties are that way, the culture will be heterogeneous. If neither, it will be homogeneous.   Now if only one party is demanding, and the other for some reason naturally acquiesces, what does that mean? That could be forced out of minority status, which is a power differential, or if it is voluntary, that would be quite extraordinary."

To say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things. For example, joking about the Holocaust, while not always situationally appropriate, helps us process the tragedy and reinforces that we won and that we aren’t letting Nazis hold that power over us any more. To say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us, while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to Nazis and Hitler. Essentially, making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics.   Now, I’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics. Don’t make Holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they’re okay with it. Don’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they’re okay with it.  However, if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic, then joke away. In that case, the offended party is in the wrong.

Its adds great flavor and texture but it’s expensive; sel gris (grey salt) serves the same purpose.

There's no local HR and it's handled at corporate in a different state.   Ok so we had a work truck that the company owned that we'd use to pick up supplies like once or twice a month. It would also be used if anyone needed to make any sort of trip for the company's reasons on company time. Well this week my boss sold it. I'm going to speculate a bit and I can't prove it at all, but I'm like 80% sure he sold it to a friend or family member for cheap. It was a great truck that even I drove a couple times and it didn't have any issues with it so I don't know why he felt like selling it.   Anyway so today we needed to pick up supplies. I'm the only one here that has a truck. Boss walked into my office and told me that if I'm not busy I need to take my truck to pick up supplies or give my keys to my coworker so he can go. I point to the coat rack I have in my office that has my motorcycle jacket and helmet hanging on it and say \"I rode my bike today\" he looked annoyed and just says \"that's going to be a problem\" and walks out of my office. When the weather is good I like to ride my bike and the weather has been amazing here the past couple weeks.   Anyway my boss came back into my office several minutes later telling me to go with my coworker in his car to my house to get my truck so we can go get the supplies. I lied and told him my wife took the truck to her sister's place like 1.5 hours away. He put his hands on his hips and shook his head visibly getting more annoyed. Told me I need to bring my truck in on Monday and he'll let me know ahead of time the next time that we're running low so I can make sure that I bring my truck in.   So I'm really annoyed myself right now. If we needed the company truck why the hell did he sell it? Anyway I don't want my personal truck to be used as a company truck and I don't like being told what I can and can't drive into work.   So my question is can I do anything about this?? Can my boss really tell me to drive my truck to work and force me to pick up supplies in it?

    "sft_question": "Question: For the average home cook, for how long should a knife stay sharp? It seems like mine goes dull within a day... The knife is one my husband got by way of his father when he moved out on his own. It says EKCO Stainless Steel on it, and it’s not a normal chef’s knife. A little googling says it might be a butchers knife, which is honestly where this might be going wrong. It looks a lot like this.  Anyway, I assumed this knife was significantly better than my cheap Walmart ones I brought into the marriage, and I’ve been using it exclusively as a chef’s knife. The knife is “sharp enough” with zero maintenance, but not slice-a-tomato-with-no-pressure sharp. So, a few months ago, I decided to learn to sharpen knives. I can get it really, really sharp for a few days, but the blade dulls down to it’s “sharp enough” before the week is out.  Is this normal? If not, is it the steel (crummy knife) or the blade (not using it for its purpose)? I also (I know! I know! I’m working on it!) don’t have a wooden cutting board. I’m using thin plastic bendable ones over a laminated counter, or a thicker plastic one. No glass, though.   So, these are my knives.

    "sft_question": "Question: Explain like I'm five years old: How can a micro-SD card store so much more data than another one with the exact same size? What's the physical difference? I was shopping a couple days ago looking for a replacement for my phone's 2gb micro-SD card and I noticed for the first time that there exist 64gb micro-SD cards.  Same exact size, shape (of course), brand and overall look. ¿What's the physical difference?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Some great answers here already, but all of them miss part of the picture.  Say you sell chocolate chip cookies. You price the cookies on how many chocolate chips are in each cookie. With each cookie being the same size, so it takes 2 bites to eat.  Essentially the cookie itself is the outside part of the SD, the packaging, it is the same interface to the gadget. It has the right shape, connectors, etc. They are all made to set specification, so that is why your 2 GB micro-SD looks the exact same on the outside as the 64 GB micro-SD.  Now you typically say want 10 chocolate chips in each cookie, but you notice after you bake them, that some cookies have 8 or 9 chocolate chips. So you sell them as having 8 chocolate chips in them and you remove 1 chip from the cookies that have 9 chips in them.  This is known as \"binning\". So SD manufacturers will try and make all their SDs as the max size they can offer, but during the manufacturing process, it isn't perfect. So some of the SDs have storage cells that don't work, so they sell those SDs at a lower price and at a lower storage size. And they might do this multiple times. Also, if a SD doesn't fit the specification of a product, like if they sell 64 GB SDs and 32 GB SDs, but this one SD comes out with 42 GB of space, they will disable the 10 GB of space and sell it as a 32 GB SD.  Lastly, two years after you started selling cookies, you are informed that the company you buy your chocolate chips from, has found a way to sell smaller Chocolate Chips, while still retaining the same amount of sweet Chocolatey goodness of the original chocolate chip all at a lower price too. So you decide to use those new chips and instead of 10 chocolate chips per cookie, you make the cookies with 20 chocolate chips.  This part is where over time, silicon chip manufacturers have been able to get more and more transistors on the same size chip, while at a lower cost. They do this by making the transistors smaller, hence the smaller chocolate chips. So over time, they have been able to fit larger storage into the same amount of physical space as than they could years ago."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: There needs to be a tax on harmful food additives and a tax cut on foods without them. Basically everything we see in the grocery store has too much stuff added into it. Added sugars and salts because they're natural preservatives, for instance. Roughly 90 percent of America's 3.5 trillion dollars of aggregate health care expenditure comes from chronic illnesses. The most dangerous of these illnesses (Besides the ones caused by cigarettes and alcohol) are mostly based on having a poor diet and exercise life. Those are of course obesity, diabetes and heart disease.  So, I'm looking for an idea that will try to tilt the economics and incentives of shopping for food in favor of healthy alternatives. I stumbled upon the idea of having a tax directly on the harmful components of food. So if an individual packaged food product has over 5% daily value of sodium, it's communicated directly into the sales tax for that product. So if it has 10% of daily value, then the sales tax would be 5%. You could work this in for excess sugars, saturated and trans fats, artificial preservatives and all manner of harmful components in food.   Obviously I don't expect cashiers at a grocery store to sit there and calculate the sales tax based on whatever is in the package. It would have to be handled by computers that would communicate the contents of what they've ordered from manufacturers directly into inventory so that it's automatically applied at the cash register and visible on the price tag on the shelf.  I understand that there would be necessary exceptions to the rule. Salt shakers for example. If a full salt shaker has 1000x your daily value of sodium, you can't very well charge 1000x the price of the product in a sales tax.  I also understand that since sugar and salt are natural preservatives, they are critical to the infrastructure of food transportation. That and the fact that sodium is very healthy for you up to a certain point are the reasons why you would start charging the tax after a daily value of 5 or 10 percent. Some sodium is necessary. It's also the case that if a food product requires that much preservation just to get to the supermarket, then it's either from too far away or it's probably not a good food product.  I see a lot of potential for this to really change people's eating habits. Ultimately, something needs to be done about American health issues stemming from diet. I don't want these taxes to range so high that it starts bankrupting companies so fast that they don't have time to change their product process. I also would want the government to properly fund diet and health related programs to better help this transition into hopefully slightly healthier lifestyles.  Let me know if you have any objections as to the efficiency or legality of such a tax. Also let me know if there are better systems of dealing with America's lack of dietary integrity.

Not sure how to move forward if I cant prove what was said. Im also debating whether or not I should speak to Amy’s boss when they come on Monday and how shes creating issues at work.

I explained to my director my side and they were shocked at how different the two stories were. I defended myself by telling her that I was just enforcing my boundaries and gave a few examples of my own of situations where people just walked all over me.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The theory that eliminating tipping would cause the restaurant industry to collapse is a conspiracy perpetuated by waitstaff and the restaurant industry Tipping is optional. Period, point blank, no ifs, ands, or buts. It’s a customers choice whether they want to tip or not and how much. The idea it is mandatory is solely based on guilt and societal pressure to conform at the detriment of the customer and the benefit of the business and waitstaff.  The customer experiences unnecessary pressure to pay an arbitrary amount of money simply for going out to eat. Meanwhile the waitstaff benefit by making often more than minimum wage. Even more so the  business benefits by having the customer pay their employee wages and put pressure on the waitstaff to turn over tables further making them more money. Imagine if Amazon decided to implement this pay scheme. They decide they’re going to pay their workers less than minimum wage and you foot the bill by adding a tip to your order. People wouldn’t stand for this and would be at Amazons throat. So why in this instance is the customer, who just wants to sit and eat, the enemy, instead of the person who decided to start a business and have someone else pay for it?   As well back of house usually isn’t getting tipped and some of them make less than the waitstaff. Where’s the outrage?

Americans literally cannot trust businesses to pay a *fair living wage* to people like servers. We have a *massive* history of this. Europe is culturally different... Not to mention different laws and much more favorable minimum wages... and free health insurance.   ...and yet...   Go eat in a mid-to-low end European restaurant and time how long it takes you to get your water glass filled, order a dessert, or pay your bill.   European service is *slow as fuck* except at the very high end.   So they aren't wrong about that...

As you moved around, objects with a specific facing, like enemies, had several images that would be swapped out.

But, as someone else mentioned - there are labs set up by the government (or other entities) which are performing COVID surveillance to identify variants. They take groups of samples identified as COVID positive - then put those samples through a genome sequencing process to identify the exact mutations."

    "sft_question": "Question: If I want to eventually do design work, is gaining experience as a graduate systems engineer a bad idea? So I got on to a grad scheme over covid at a huge consultancy. I have a masters in mechanical engineering and originally applied for that. But they moved me on to systems. I took the job because tbh, there was no other option at the time.   They haven’t really given me any interesting work. Or at least any technical work. It doesn’t even really feel like engineering it’s just asset management right now and if I hadn’t found ways to make it technical I’d be struggling.   I had originally thought (like some other grads on my team) that systems would be more modelling and simulation type work. Coming up with initial system design ideas. Etc. that appealed to me. The basic documenting and management of assets does not.   I was kinda hoping that they’d at least be flexible on how often I needed to be in the office too with me taking the job while working from home in a different city. But they haven’t been. They’re now demanding I’m in 3 days a week and that’s not easy considering my current situation.   It’s making me wonder if I should apply elsewhere. As I’m on a grad programme I had hoped they’d let me experience the mechanical side too, get some design work. They advertised it as a way to develop the skills you want to for your career and let you experience the whole consultancy. It isn’t that at all right now.   Should I leave and find something else where I can hone my technical skills? Or is it good experience seeing the whole engineering lifecycle first and then trying to find that.   Thanks\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: WTF is horsepower and does it actually matter? I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post it, but I figured you guys would hopefully know the answer.     I'm a long time car guy, certified engine machinist, automotive nutcase. Something I've been having a hard time with recently is horsepower. This all came about because I was discussing gear shift points for maximum acceleration, with some fellows on the interweb. Many people were of the erroneous understanding that the best time to shift for maximum acceleration is at peak hp, however the actual answer is based on current torque x current gear ratio compared to shifted torque x shifted gear ratio.   What really stands out to me is that from a peak acceleration perspective, hp has literally no part of this calculation. Which then made me wonder, why on earth do we care about hp then? All you ever hear talk about is hp, and many manufacturers go out of their way to prioritize peak hp over ample torque, especially when designing a race oriented vehicle.  I've watched videos before explaining what hp is and why it matters, but I feel like they always glaze over most of the important details and skip right to the end result. I also feel like my current shift calculation/acceleration context is probably skewing my perspective and making it harder to wrap my head around. Help me please!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "OP, it seems to me like your assessment that torque is all that matters is based on the fact that the online calculators use the torque curve as their input, and not the hp curve. What I think you are missing is that the torque curve and the hp curve are two different representations of exactly the same data. Give me one and I can directly calculate the other. So, the calculators could have been written to use the hp curve as the input if they wanted to, I guess it’s just convenient to use the torque curve. Fundamentally though, both curves are showing the same thing, just in two different ways."

The most common one, in my experience, is that you finish off your own paper.  > as first author, is this still your responsibility if you no longer work for those PIs  I find this a bit of an odd perspective.  The responsibility derives from the fact that you are first author: it is *your* paper, about *your* work.  None of that depends on who is paying your salary.  If you've left research and don't mind burning some bridges then sure, you can refuse to work on it and the professional ramifications will be fairly limited.

There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is. I don't \\*think\\* they are merely blowtorching sugar onto the pastry because it's not burnt. I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity). I've also tried rolling the dough in sugar before forming the danish like a kouign amann, which was good but far from their effect.  &#x200B;  Are there other ideas I may be missing?

Keep in mind, many if not most religions that inspired these things wouldn't be agreeable with Western Fundamentalist Christianity, but religion is one of the things that always gets funding in many societies to achieve things like large temples that required unique ingenuity that may not have been seen before. Yes, the Romans, for example, built many non religious structures that puzzled even much more recent explorers long after the Fall of Rome- but the thing that preserved much of the Roman information was the Christian Monastery and then the Islamic Monastery.      Even in early, rural, America; Christianity played a part in challenging and developing the intellectual side of humanity. Over generations, even people who were incredibly poor would pass down the family King James Bible, which is now what we would consider at an eighth grade reading level.

I don't think your thesis is possible. Groups of people have always and everywhere tried to answer questions they were not readily equiped to answer yet.   Aside from that, you have no clue how societies would have organized if there was no yearning for the supernatural. What would have become of all the vast resources of the ancient world invested in megalomaniacal, useless building projects? Which breakthroughs could've been developed hundreds, if not thousands, of years earlier without censorship and limitations imposed by religious institutes?  The world did not fully start blossoming until the secular humanist values of the enlightenment came about. As religion started to demystify so did our natural world with all the splendor of our modern technology and science as a result.  So I disagree with you. That doesn't mean that religion hasn't been a strong tool in history to allocate funds. And that sometimes it accidentally hit the nail on the head and caused societies to progress scientifically and technologically. That doesn't mean however that the dogmatic restrictions imposed on the population, and the strongly anti-scientific claims in most religions, didn't extremely hamper progress as well."

    "sft_question": "Question: Jealousy in academia and how to deal with it Dear people of Reddit,  It’s time for me to get a reality check and hopefully some good advice from the hivemind. Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am currently working Post-PhD and have a good number of papers out (h-index >20).  I am struggling with irrational feelings when it comes to the work of others, and I want to work on that. Some of this I potentially can attribute to some experiences during my Ph.D. that I will detail later.  At its core, I am getting jealous of my co-workers for their success. If someone submits a paper and gets good reviews, I have a hard time feeling happy for them. On this note, I also have issues celebrating my own success. Whenever there is work that I think is subpar, I feel that they had it easy. This is particularly the case when I see people making quick studies, e.g., when the project and publication process runs smoothly. Whenever I see that a co-worker does solid work, I get envious and think why I didn’t do this. I then have the feeling that they have found their niche, and I am sad that I don’t have mine - although I probably, objectively have one.   The absurd thing is that this is even the case when I am a co-author of a study - so even when I would benefit from my colleagues’ success.  From my Ph.D. I instilled some unhealthy “rules” from a very ambitious PI. Some of them are obviously very questionable, but those are some of the first thoughts that come up in my mind and might help to rationalize what I am feeling:  1. You need to be the first or corresponding author of a study so that it has value. >> I guess this is why I don’t value being “just” a co-author on a paper. 2. The value of a paper is dependent on the journal. >> Before I see myself asking what the study is about, I rather think about the journal. 3. My Ph.D.-PI had very high standards and would become very nit-picky. >> e.g., when I find a typo, I devalue work disproportionally and assume the findings won’t hold up. I get angry when I see published work that has questionable data quality 4. Once you finish a paper, directly move on to the next one. >> I have a hard time reflecting and celebrating success - or rather acknowledging success. I often talk my work down. I recently published a paper with very good reviews and then had nagging thoughts that others published in higher-impact journals.  This often leads to the feeling that I am glad that it is over and not that I achieved something, as there is always something \"better\".  5. Metrics are everything. >> I check out people’s track records on Google Scholar and compare myself and devalue people with fewer papers / lower citations. I get upset when they are further along the line.   I am happy that I can share this here and would be looking forward to hearing perspectives or maybe strategies on how to work on this — or even telling me this is normal.  Thanks a lot.\nAnswer: ",

I suspect that you learned these “rules” from you parents way before they were reinforced by your advisor. A lot of folks who succeed in academic circles tie their self-worth to their work because as kids we learned that academic success would get us praise from our parents. You’re a full fledged person not a list of citations. You say that you get on with your lab mates and enjoy their company so I think the resentment might be related to feeling like you don’t get as much attention as they do when you have success. Is it possible that when you do succeed you don’t allow yourself to enjoy the win ? Also if you can try to take a little time off. You probably are getting burned out and that’s fueling your resentment."

Those in attendance receive gifts but are forced to acknowledge the gift-givers supremacy.  This takes place primarily in terms of *how many pigs* he can slaughter / give away for one big party.   'A  man is nothing without pigs' he says. The  gifts also include literal cash  and   I think even a Jeep makes it into the mix as part of the booty if I recall.  They take this practice so seriously that his rivals actually try to spoil the festivities by accusing him of sorcery, which spooks the people in attendance  and becomes a big distraction before the main event.  They do this hoping that his 'Moka' might fail and he cannot claim the status it would bestow on him if successful.  It's 'weaponized' in that once the gifts are given,  someone else has to outdo him if they want to raise their own  status. Like a Moka leaderboard.  A successful Moka means other men are lowered down in the social hierarchy, the giver is raised up.   People are so threatened by it they are willing to sow discord and potentially kill to stop it.   They are going  to get lots of useful free  stuff and food but  they don't want to suffer the social degradation of accepting them.

I've noticed a lot of time when I order pork dishes from Chinese restaurants, the meat has an especially strong, robust pork flavor, which I love. Of all the pork I've ever bought in a grocery store, or pork dishes I've had from other types of restaurants, most of it is fairly bland and doesn't taste like much other than the seasoning or marinade/sauce it's cooked with.

I eat a lot of Chinese food and I'd say about 75% of the time the pork has some amount of this flavor, and it's stronger and more likely in very traditional and high-end restaurants.

Another place where the chef prides himself on doing thing in a very traditional way has this great flavor in all their pork.  I really have no idea what it is. A specific breed of pork?

Pita pocket style - Either using pita bread or a round roll, cut in half, slice or pull apart the soft bread part with your hands or knife, stuff in your fillings and enjoy 2. Hotdog style - slice a long roll down the side about 80% of the way through such that you still have a bread hinge and it opens like a book. Fill accordingly and enjoy. Not too much otherwise filling can squeeze out of top and ends. If you have to stuff it, scoop out some of the bread first. 3.

If you're keeping ends open, wrap a little plastic wrap or foil just one one side (doesn't have to go all the way up) just to catch and runaway ingredients or juices 4. I must have an actual sandwich method - This one requires a little thinking with its construction. Moderation is the key. Better to have two sandwiches moderately filled than one mega one. My take would be to:    1. Toast insides of muffin/bread at the very least (outsides too if you want). Dryer bread helps with absorption.    2. If you want sauce on your sandwich, this is the very first thing you do after toasting. Either, top or bottom or both. I prefer side not with egg as the yolk is the \"sauce\" on that side. Don't use too much of it or shit slides around.    3. Sunny side up egg or eggs over easy (singular), pierce yolk so it starts running and cap with one slice of bread. Then flip with spatula so egg bleeds yolk into bread, which absorbs it. That slice of bread is the bottom biatch of the sandwich.    4. Next the meat. Add it on top of the egg. Not too thick of a layer or shit slides around.    5. Next cheese. If you wanted it melted, grill it first on the other slice of muffin/bread under broiler/grill. Otherwise, place on top of meat and close sandwich.    6. Let it all sit for a moment to allow bread to absorb juices. Then eat.  Finally, if you absolutely must do this all in a sealed ball of dough, use a poached or onsen egg (i.e. one where yolk is still runny) and have egg sit in the centre protected by a blanket of meat and cheese. Then deep fry that shit. Baking it will take too long and cook the egg too much in a closed setting. You can make it work in an open setting like with a tart with egg on top but you asked for closed sandwich, not open faced.  Hopefully one of those methods works for you, my man. Godspeed."

My child is male 11 months old and started running high fevers on Friday afternoon, his pediatrician directed me to take him to the hospital bc I couldn’t get his fever down with medication and he is not eating or drinking and the office is closed until Monday.

He is breastfed, so he is nursing more than he normally would, but he still refuses food and drink. His temperature stays around 103 on medicine.

Hello everyone, I’m not sure if this has been asked yet or it’s even relevant but I have been thinking about this for some time and would like your input. I’m not an engineer, but I’m curious if those of you who are think of how things actually get built by the labourers and tradesmen on site. Just as an example I’m in shallow utility construction and I am often perplexed at who the hell thought of designing an electrical system the way the did. A lot of the time it seems like the person drawing up the plans for a project just wants to make things difficult for us. I know that there are regulations and that things are designed the way they are for a reason, and that it’s not just engineers but inspectors, pm’s and everyone in between who needs to do their job so that the project can be completed safely and properly however arduous the task may be once everyone has added their two cents. Do engineers think about how hard something will actually be to build and attempt to make things easier for the guy on the ground, or is it all function in the end?   Ps. This isn’t a dig at engineers, I’ve got nothing but respect for what you people do to keep the world running.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In an ideal world we do.      But a lot of the time the combination of time restrictions and budget restrictions prevent it.      Consulting engineers are on a budget and time restriction, they just don't have the time to design things to be buildable, you have to put out the cheapest possible design that will work.     I know this is prevalent in civil engineering, I imagine its lets so when an engineer is designing something for the company they work for to make, because then the cost of unbuildable designs starts to impact the company the engineer works for.     Its the old truism, you can pick two between cheap fast and good, most people only pay for cheap and fast.     And remember, if you have to issue an RFI, thats probably not in the contract so the engineer gets to have a change order at the end for all the time they spend on it."

Career flexibility, career growth, remote work potential, etc are all additional reasons. You should also make sure you don’t hate/dislike SWE. Being miserable in the career after two years and wanting to go back and/or change again can quickly wipe out the “for the money” benefit.   FWIW the 90+ percentile Mech E makes ~50th percentile SWE money. Even in big FAANG, the base salary for a given level might not be too far off, but the stock grants and the advancement will be where the massive disparity lies.  Oh and not to mention regarding your “love for mech E”, I have it too but I’ll tell you the job can feel way way different from small mech E low paying job to high paying mech E tech job at a megacorp. Many of those jobs feel way different, and you might not like it as you thought you did (or at least more than software).

    "sft_answer": "It can. However, the fuel gear is not designed to cope with it.  For diesel injection, the critical property for the correct atomisation of fuel is the viscosity of the fuel. Too high viscosity and the fuel droplets are too large, too low and you actually get a fuel jet rather than a fine mist. In fact, large marine diesel engines can run on a wide range of fuels from light gasoils to heavy residual fuels, as long as the viscosity is controlled appropriately.  The correct viscosity also provides a lubricating effect to the fuel pumps and injectors. Using petrol in a diesel engine usually results in massively excessive wear."

    "sft_answer": "I'm not a PhD student, but I'm a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry."

    "sft_question": "Question: My Dog bit a kid who wouldn't leave him alone. They want him to be put down. My Dog is a German Shepard has never bit anyone. He isn't stupid or aggressive but, he doesn't like being pet on by random strangers unless I've given consent. He wont bite but, he will shy away but, if you kept on trying to pet him he would likely bite. I mean would you like to have strangers come up and start touching you? No way.  I was at the park and this group of kids kept coming over and trying to pet him. I told them no twice. My dog was already uncomfortable and clearly did not like it. We finally pulled away. I had to pee so I tied him up to the post near the door. He's a good boy so I know he wouldn't bark or run off. Next thing I know I hear a scream.   The kid got bit. After I told him 3x do not touch my dog he goes and tries to pet him.  The kid isnt bleeding much just a small nip. My dog is freaked out and cowering. An adult comes by and calls animal control citing \"The dog is aggressive and dangerous and viciously attacked a child\".  AC come by and so do the Parents. AC take my dog away for testing for rabies; and the Mom is angry. The kid says he went to pet my dog and the dog lunged at him and tried taking his hand off. I know that's a lie because, my dog is well trained and has never bit anyone or shown signs of aggression. Dogs dont just randomly go crazy. He does like being pet and I told that kid he doesn't so dont pet him.  The Mom is sobbing and saying she wants my \"vicious\" dog put to sleep because, he's a danger to everyone around him.  She ignored everything I said regarding me warning the kid not too pet him.  I'm just frazzled right now. My dog is currently being detained and I dont know if he'll be coming back. All he did was nip a kid who wouldnt take no for an answer.  What is my next step? I want to act fast before she takes legal action and to protect my dog.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: How do you cope that you won't deliver a good thesis due to the pandemic? I will finish my PhD next year, but this week I entered the existencial crisis of a PhD: my thesis will not be good. I receive a scholarship from my government to develop my project, which I received after proposing three main objectives, two of them a bit risky but were mangeable - before covid hit. Since the pandemic began, everything I do came to a complete standstill, as I have to work on the laboratory, which was closed for almost a full year. I have a salary until July of next year, but I don't know what I will do until then or even after.  My country (brazil) is in the middile of a 3rd wave, with a 4th wave incoming. My state's healthcare system has already collapsed. Me and the other laboratory members have, since past month, made an agenda where we have no more than 2 people at the same time (so everyone has exactly one day in the week to do their work), but we all know that if we were to catch covid, it's stay at home and hope you don't die, because there is no more oxygen, hospital beds, the medicines used are slowly ending as well, and no vaccination in sight for us (in the brightest scenario, late november to mid december)  My first objective has been completely cancelled, impossible to do until late 2022, because the facility has closed. The second one involves an experimental technique that we still haven't been able to finish developing (people involved have left the city/state due to covid, facilities are still not open, purchase of new chemical reagents has been slow because everything is out of stock). The third objective requires me travelling to another side of the country (about 10h by bus) and spend some weeks working in another laboratory, something that not only is not recommended to due in the midst of our health crisis, but also I do not feel comfortable in doing as my immune system sucks and I'm very prone to getting sick, which is why I have been in quarantine for as much as I can, only leaving home for the essentials (and more recently to work).  So there we have it. I don't have anything to continue with my original plans and objectives, I don't know if I have a story to tell with all the incomplete and broken data that I have, and I'm scared shitless of having to do a complete 180º on my project which, if it's not accepted by my funding agency, they have the right to cancel my scholarship and demand that I pay them back everything that they have given me, which I mostly ceratinly cannot do. Besides changing everything when I have about 14 to 15 months left on my PhD (after this time I will be without a scholarship, and I cannot survive here without it due to money reasons), the only alternative I see is to lengthen this PhD until god knows when, when I'm finally able to complete all three objectives. I am absolutely lost, and later today I also have a meeting with my advisor because he wants to talk about my project...\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I lost basically an entire year reshuffling to figure out how to make a 180° shift in plans.

I'm an ME with 1 year of experience working in mechanical design in a niche industry. I'm pretty underpaid (making $66k in a VHCOL because it was what I could get), and recently I've been seriously thinking about starting to go down the software path (whether it's web dev or anything else) because the pay seemed so much better. Just doing a quick search for entry level developer jobs in my city showed the lower end of the entry level salaries at 80\\~90k which is almost 50% more of what I'm making now, and most of them didn't even require a degree.. That's not including the FAANG pay which is on a whole other level.. That and the fact that their jobs are way more flexible and in higher demand and that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon.  Now the problem is that I genuinely like ME, but it seems like the a senior ME salary is the same as an entry level software salary these days and the gap is growing every day..    What do you guys think.. Is doing it just for the money a good idea?      Thanks in advance!\nAnswer: ",

I had enough experience with arduinos and the like to leverage an entry level embedded software role and have never looked back. Totally worth it, and yes I make a lot more than I did as an ME, but I jumped because I wanted to like my work. The money will definitely make it go down smooth, but if you find software boring you're going to be miserable."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The body positivity movement has long since forgotten about - possibly even never included - men. It goes without saying that the body positivity movement has been beneficial for women of all different shapes and sizes world wide; comprehensive, and intersectional discussions about things from stretch marks, to body hair, to  cellulite - and I’m all for these things. Women deserve to be confident in their skin, with their bodies, and free from superficial judgements levied against them by their peers or themselves.   Men, on the other hand, have been left in the dust. Look at the top 5 social media accounts that turn up when you search body positivity - they are not only run by women, but usually geared towards women, with some rare exceptions of particularly progressive accounts which may have some representation for Trans and non-binary folks.   Men’s bodies are still, in large, viewed in the dichotomy of attractive, or not, with less wiggle room on top traits men tend to be insecure about, whether they can help it (e.g usually physical fitness) or not (e.g previously listed issues for women, height, penis size, baldness, etc.)  Of course, I’m not suggesting some incel-mindset “these men don’t deserve love” or “beta versus alpha” propaganda, nor am I suggesting men necessarily require this kind of social support,  but the last bit discussion about men’s bodies had to do with the “dad-bod” craze of the mid-2010s, which still focused on large part on a specialized aspect of men, rather than a respect for their body the way the discourse surrounding body-positivity did for women.  I speculate these things don’t exist for men in part because of societal expectations on men as to be less concerned with their physical appearance (as not to be perceived as being girly/ supporting traditional gender roles) or show weakness regarding sense of self towards others (also gender roles.) However I also think their exclusion from the origin of body positivity may have inadvertently closed the door in the face of many men willing to open up regarding body identity.  With all that being said, I realize men, and women, and people in general cannot be generalized so simply. I know there are men unconcerned and comfortable in their own skin just as much as their are men willing to talk and require the help from communities online and in person, and I know there are many content creators who want to have men at the table to normalize discussions, but by in large, the “movement” of body positivity has long since left men behind.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In our culture, men have never been stigmatized for being overweight in the same way that women have been. You can find countless movies and sitcoms where a fat male character has a fit and attractive wife (ex: King of Queens) but you would never find a situation where a fit guy is with a fat woman. Men being overweight has always been seen as a fact of life. Women being overweight has been treated like a transgression. It’s no wonder that the body pos movement finds more traction with women."

My job is incredibly challenging, I’m on my toes all day long, solving problems, answering questions and overall see the project grow and evolve. I just love it! I have many different hobbies and outside interests, I’m an artist, a photographer, love to hike and bike and I live in Florida with great outdoors all year long. I have a very balanced life.

Considering that the attack on the homestead was meant to look like being the work of the Tusken, who neither own nor use flamethrowers and especially not disintegrators, and we don't see both kind of weapons in the Sandtroopers arsenal for this mission, the most likely weapon that caused the condition of Owen and Beru's corpses are blasters.  Blasters were shown to be able to turn people into charred corpses a short time later in ANH, when we see Han shoot Greedo in the Mos Eisley cantina. Perhaps another reason for this scene, beside giving him a reason to travel with Obi Wan and Luke to Alderaan.  And why would Sandtroopers, trying to imitate a Tusken raid, give their victims a funeral? We never seen or heard about them doing this anywhere.   And simply burning along with the homestead also doesn't make sense, because the corpses lay outside and not in one of the destroyed rooms of the moisture farm.  And people often forget that George hadn't the idea of stormtroopes using thermal detonators, flamethrowers or disintegrators when he made ANH or at least didn't introduced them at this point. The only hand weapons we see anyone use in the movie are blasters, gaffi sticks and lightsabers.  So is it possible that highly powered blaster fire from more than one Stormtrooper could turn Owen and Beru Lars into charred skeletons?\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: [MCU/Yu-Gi-Oh] The soul stone's guardian is Atem and the only way he'll let somebody get the stone is if they beat him in a game of Duel Monsters. What's Thanos game plan? Would Thanos try recruiting somebody skilled at this random Earth game and have them try to win it for him? Does he actually take it upon himself to master the game and dedicates his time to study the meta?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "He has no way of interacting with spirits. Although we never see him try to combat red skull in IW, there’s no reason for him to try and overpower Atem. He comes to Atem blind, just as he came to red skull blind. Atem’s a good sport, and wouldn’t refuse a challenge, but Thanos doesn’t have a deck, so he would either a) have to come back, or B) Atem would let him borrow a decent deck, as well as a rules handbook.   Also, is this Atem from the end of Duel Monsters, or Atem from Yu-Gi-Oh (season 0 of the anime)? Atem at the end of duel monsters has solidified himself as the king of games, proven himself as the best duelist in the world, with the exception of Yugi, who defeats him to place him into his final rest.   Duel Monsters Atem will beat thanos in the initial encounter, no questions asked. At this point, thanos likely tries to overpower Atem and take the stone by force, but he can’t interact with spirits, let alone the guardian of the soul stone, and is transported to another location on the planet.   Thanos would have to study the game, and come back with a counter deck to Atem. Problem is, Atem probably won’t accept the challenge; thanos disrespected the King of Games by not respecting the outcome of a fair duel. His only option is to send goons over and over again until someone manages to beat Atem, but that’s never going to happen. Eventually, they start kidnapping duelists from Earth; but thanos doesn’t do covert missions very well, and the avengers intervene in the kidnapping of the duel monsters world champion.   If the kidnapping succeeds, I doubt a duel monster champion would be able to keep his composure against Atem, and would promptly lose. No human can deal with the actual King of Games, with an optimized deck as well as perfect draws.  If we assume that the isolation of living on an isolated planet for an undetermined amount of time reverts Atem to OG Atem. (Original Yu-Gi-Oh manga, Season 0 of the anime.) then thanos is screwed. Thanos loses the initial duel, and Atem mind-shatters him.   The only reason Atem plays nice in duel monsters is because Yugi plays his conscience. With Yugi gone, Atem is gonna be a-ok with penalty gaming thanos for any infringement on his predetermined rules.  Either way, I just don’t see any way that Thanos could win this. 10/10 Atem. People are saying “thanos just uses a hostage” but thanos has no reason to do that. And Atem would just penalty game him for breaking the rules."

    "sft_answer": "Maritime Navigators knew it first / have always known.   When rigging the sails, somebody securing the top mast at one point MUST have said \"Ahoy! Enemy vessel to starboard side!\"  Then that same person scrambled down the rigging only to find that the same ship was not visible from the deck.  Confused, this same person must have scrambled back up the top mast, only to see the enemy vessel slowly come into view from the top to the bottom. First the top mast appears. Then the sails. Then the prow. Then finally the hull.  What possible explanation could they have derived other than \"the ocean seems to run downhill. Always. In every direction. So: the earth must curve downhill.

I now love making garam masala rolls, or five spice zucchini bread, or carrot cake with miso cream cheese frosting.   Using a predetermined guide will limit you to what someone else thinks works well. But I guess they can be a good starting point. For me the best place to learn is to actually taste flavors myself.

This means you can be intelligent without being creative but how can this be since high fluid intelligence is related to solving novel problems independent of previously acquired knowledge isn't this just creativity?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Fluid intelligence is a term created in the 1950s in the field of psychometry which is a controversial branch of psychology focused an attaching quantifiable measurements to psychological characteristics. It’s controversial because it’s based entirely on correlation and there is no way to demonstrate that the characteristics are actually caused by the thing being measured.  Fluid intelligence is one half of a theory of intelligence put forward in the 60s which posited that general intelligence can be reduced into two subcategories: fluid intelligence which is the ability to solve novel problems and crystalized intelligence which is the capacity to store and execute known solutions to a problem.  Creativity is not a part of that model."

So in my personal opinion, to have only 2 parties, both of which being completely opposite In view, is somewhat detrimental to progress. From what I’ve seen, if you go too far into 1 belief like for instance left or right leaning views, then it ultimately descends into fanaticism and dictatorship.  Now these may not be the best examples, but here are two of the biggest and most obvious ones : the nazis and Stalinism. Both are examples of leaning way too far into one belief to the point that it ultimately descends into a dictatorship. Now of course there were multiple factors that made both things horrible of course, but I feel that both being essentially as far right and left leaning as possible respectively is a contributor.  But I’d rather digress and get to the main point. When you have two sides that are both entirely dedicated to one side of the argument then you get no progress as both sides will be completely unable to be convinced on the other sides arguments.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Donald Trump played the Republican Party and is not a Republican I personally believe President Donald Trump is not a Republican by value, but a Fascist.  I do not throw that word around, and I do not mean it as an insult, I literally mean he is a fascist.     Let me first expose why I don’t believe he is a Republican or has Republican values: 1.\tDonald Trump is “very pro choice”.  He stated this in an interview in 1999 on Meet The Press. 2.\tDonald Trump has a very limited knowledge of the Bible.  I know this is a stretch, but the GOP in the US has very strong Biblical beliefs, and many of their stances are based around said book (against gay marriage, pro life, etc).  This came to fruition when he mispronounced II Corinthians as “two Corinthians”, and even more so when he stated he never asked for forgiveness because he doesn’t do anything bad. 3.\tDonald Trump wants to expand government’s power over it’s citizens, not reduce it.  He stated last year that he’s a fan of Eminent Domain, and is actively using it to acquire land near the Mexican border for his wall.  Through his cutting back of funding for the EPA (which educates and provides regulations that keep air and water more clean), the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor.     My support for him being a fascist: 1.\tHis leaning towards a corporatist economic system.  He is promoting massive tax cuts for wealthy companies, but hardly touching small, 100 employees or less companies.  Removing the restrictions of Dodd-Frank, which protects individuals from predatory lending and collection practices is one such move. 2.\tAttempting to discredit media.  We can all agree that MSM has it’s own agenda, that really isn’t what’s up for discussion here.  What is, however, is his attempt to decide what is “true” and “fake” news.  He has labeled CNN as “Fake News”, while praising Fox and Friends.  He seems to do this not on a basis of fact/fiction, but on a basis of whether or not they agree with him.  Just yesterday, during the FBI and NSA hearings, he called the hearings “Fake News” even though they were literally happening while he was tweeting about it.  He is attempting to claim a monopoly on the truth. 3.\tPower through military.  His budget proposal cuts social welfare programs, environmental protection programs, and education programs to bolster our already large military.   4.\tAttempting to discredit other branches of government.  We all remember that “SEE YOU IN COURT!” tweet he put out as he lost a court battle regarding the banning of people from certain nations, but the courts aren’t the only one.  He has bashed Congress several times over the past few years, and especially during the election.  Claiming the courts are “liberal” (ie. Against what he wants) if they find him wrong, and supporting those that agree with him. 5.\tHis history of alleged sexual abuse.  Mussolini labeled women as “reproducers of the nation” and recommended against employing them.  It’s almost as though Trump shares this view and sees them as objects rather than human beings.  Whether it’s walking into the changing rooms at pageants or “grabbing them by the *****”, or the several allegations of sexual misconduct against him, we have to admit his history with women is a bit rocky at best. 6.\tRacial/National division.  Trump has repeatedly kicked minorities out of his rallies, including some who claim to have been legitimately there to learn his stances.  His quotes on people from Mexico and Muslims go without saying as well.  “A ban on all Muslims from entering the country” is one of his campaign promises.  Most people will say “Muslim’s aren’t a race”, but let me clarify: a race is just a shared characteristic between groups of people.  It doesn’t have to be physical color.  It can be nationality, religion, skin color, disability, etc. I am posting this here legitimately out of trying to understand where he stands.

I bought a bunch of salmon heads, and was planning on making stock with them, but I don't have any other fish bones, only the heads. All recipes for fish stock I see online call for a variety of different bones. Is there a particular reason for this, or will only fish heads produce a tasty stock? Thanks!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I wouldn't recommend it, but yes it is possible. You won't get the best tasting fish stock if you want a blanco ( white ) fish stock.  I would recommend to first take out the gills ( hope I wrote it right ), the eyes ( keep them ! ). And roast the whole Salmom head in the oven to get rid of the fat. Then make a dark fish stock out  of the head.  The eyes, you can put them in tin foil and smoke them, you will get an amazing smoked fish stock out of the eyes with a lot of collagen. 👍🏽  Hope I could give you a bit of an advice here. 💩"

    "sft_question": "Question: Does a full refrigerator use more energy than an empty one? Two identical refrigerators set to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.  A is empty, B has a 24 pack of canned beer, already chilled to 40 degrees.     Situation 1:  The door is never opened.   My intuition is that they use the same amount of energy. Is that correct?  Situation 2: The door is opened once a day.  My intuition is that fridge B will use less energy.  When you open fridge A, warm air comes in that needs to be chilled.  In fridge B, less warm air enters because of the beer.  Beer has a high specific heat and so holds its chill while the fridge door is open.  Is that correct?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In a simplified textbook world you are right about both situations, above the effect of opening the door is small enough that it's not worth worrying about that.  But in real life, in situation 1 there can be a quite significant difference. That's because the refrigerator's cooling system, the heat pump, cycles on and off controlled by a thermostat.  When there's more thermal mass inside, it will cycle on and off more slowly.  In an idealized model, that wouldn't matter. If it ran 25% of the time, it wouldn't matter whether that was 1 hour out of four hours or one minute out of 4 minutes.  But the actual vapor compression refrigeration cycle relies on maintaining a pressure difference between the condenser and the evaporator.  Each time it turns on, the compressor needs to first build up that pressure difference before much of work the compressor is doing goes into refrigeration.  Then when it turns off, the pressures equalize between the condenser and evaporator, losing the work that was done to build up that pressure difference.  So there's a certain amount of energy wasted for each cycle, and the slower cycling fridge with the higher thermal mass uses less energy over the course of a day.  Note that better refrigerators will have smart* controls that will avoid having it cycle too fast even if there's very little inside.  But in order to prevent the short cycling, they have to allow the temperature inside to swing up and down more than it would if they allowed the fast cycling, and more than it would if the fridge was full.  Having the temperature cycle up and down a lot is worse for keeping food fresh, so even in that case, having more thermal mass inside is beneficial even if its effect on energy savings is reduced.  *By smart I mean a really basic level of well-designed controls, not being connected to the internet or having a color touch panel on the front or anything like that."

    "sft_question": "Question: [MCU/Marvel] Why do superheroes not collaborate more/share resources in the marvel universe? I've been thinking about this alot especially as a big fan of the marvel movies. Why do the superheroes not share resources/technology or aid more with one another in the marvel universe? I want to be clear i absolutely love these movies and these characters but they seem to constantly go \"lone wolf\" and put themselves or their mission in danger when it is completely unnecessary. Even if it meant waiting to resolve the situation until help could arrive to ensure the best possible outcome  For example in Spiderman- No Way Home, Peter Parker struggles tremendously against the villains in that film and it costs him his aunt may and nearly MJ. He did at one point have the help of Dr. Strange but in fairness they had a disagreement on the proper resolution to the situation so i will allow that. Why didn't Peter make a phone call or send an Avengers SOS to Sam Wilson, Hulk, Hawkeye, Antman or any of the thousands of people that showed up in the Endgame battle? He did have the help of the other spidermen but at that point he had already lost his aunt. In Endgame we see that the heroes were able to regroup and rally into a large fighting force really quickly if the situation demands it. The multiverse was literally tearing itself apart. In Falcon and the Winter soldier we see that  Sam as the new Captain America had a pretty good handle on the situation but why not call Spider-man or Hulk for back up just in case? He clearly had to travel the long distance from Louisiana to New York, why not make a quick phone call to ask Avengers that might be nearby for help if they are available? If it meant saving more lives why not? Sam and Bucky are both military veterans and should know better than anyone the value of having a solid team and backup in any situation, regardless of how good of a handle you think you have on the situation.  Secondly, why dont the Avengers share technology and resources. We see in Falcon and the Winter Soldier that Sam is in dire financial straits due to the Avengers not actually paying him. Why is this? Even as an informal group why wouldn't Tony fund the group with paychecks and equipment? We see in Age of Ultron that he reformatted Stark tower into a makeshift base of operations. Why not make the Avengers unofficial stark employees so they could be compensated for their time? Peter seems to be the only one that received some manner of compensation in the form of a scholarship and a suit.  With regard to equipment i dont understand why Tony didn't give everyone a mini upgrade to their equipment. Spiderman receives an excellent nanotech suit but why didn't he give Captain America a suit that gives him a strength or speed boost? Hawkeye and Black Widow are incredibly skilled but a basic set of nanotech body armor, even without any bells and whistles would keep them much safer and maybe add a few additional tricks into their arsenal. I dont see why they would turn it down out of \"personal preference\" if it meant it an emergency situation that it might mean the difference between life and death for civilians or themselves. Quicksilver might've been saved incredibly easily if he was wearing a pretty basic Stark tech level set of body armor. Or Hawkeye could've saved himself if he had that shield generator that stark used in Endgame.  &#x200B;  For clarification im not saying the full might of the Avengers was necessary for every mugger and car crash. But for the big stuff... why dont they ask each other for help?\nAnswer: ",

Why did Donald Trump, an already excruciatingly wealthy man, use his charitable foundation simply to enrich himself further? Your question is in the same vein.  I mean, your question, in a nutshell, is why doesn’t Tony Stark give his fellow Avengers money and upgrade their tech and I think the answer is a cynical, but realistic one: because Tony Stark is a billionaire and billionaires don’t become, or remain, billionaires by being selfless.    One might argue that even his superhero’ing was more about adventure and self-aggrandizing than nobility.   Don’t get me wrong. He isn’t completely heartless. He seems to care about himself and people he cares about. He puts Bruce Banner up between the events of Avengers and Avengers 2, for example. But that’s because Bruce becomes his friend. He looks out for Peter. But he was aware of Pete well before Civil War. He only contacted Peter when he needed an ally for Civil War and then just happened to grow fond of the kid. He wasn’t so much looking out for him out of pure altruism.   So why would he help out Sam, someone he seemed to only know in passing or casually? Or Bucky, someone he actively resented?   Even after the Snap, Tony’s reaction was to blame someone else (Steve) and then go into seclusion for several years, ignoring his friends and the world at large, and all the problems the Snap caused that a man with his abilities, intellect, and wealth could undoubtedly help solve. Doesn’t that sound exactly like what someone such as Elon Musk would do if things didn’t go his way? Look at his reaction to Twitter’s failures and I think you have your answer.   So, cynical though it might sound, I think the answer is simply that Tony Stark is a billionaire and while we see him in a positive light as the protagonist of these movies, in-universe he’s probably still a pretty shit person like most (if not all) billionaires are in real life."

    "sft_answer": ">What social/cultural/political developments led to homophobia in Russia?  &#x200B;  Nothing \"led to\" it.  Russian cultural attitudes towards sexuality are more or less what they've always been.  The Western world has changed a lot in its attitude towards homosexuality, sexuality and gender- Russia not so much.  So the \"origins of\" - really lie as much in  the West as in Russia. North Americans had similar attitudes towards, say, same sex marriage as Russia does - in 1990. Our ideas changed, theirs not so much. Russia has always had a very ambivalent relationship with ideas from the West -sometimes embracing them, only to become less enthusiastic and then to repudiate them.  There was some impulse towards \"erotic glasnost\" in the 1990s, but didn't get that far.   Russia retains some aspects of Soviet era health and morality policies - abortion and divorce were part of the secularization that followed the Bolshevik revolution, and have substantially \"stuck\" in the culture. Homosexuality, though, while decriminalized after 1920, was substantially suppressed by Stalin.  You might compare with Poland - politically aligned against Putin's Russia, but culturally the Law & Society Party have very similar views about gender and sexuality. Indeed, Russia is notable in still basically allowing abortion up to 12 weeks, while its been essentially abolished in Poland.  See  * Costlow, Jane T., Stephanie Sandler, and Judith Vowles, eds.

A is empty, B has a 24 pack of canned beer, already chilled to 40 degrees.     Situation 1:  The door is never opened.   My intuition is that they use the same amount of energy. Is that correct?  Situation 2: The door is opened once a day.  My intuition is that fridge B will use less energy.  When you open fridge A, warm air comes in that needs to be chilled.  In fridge B, less warm air enters because of the beer.  Beer has a high specific heat and so holds its chill while the fridge door is open.  Is that correct?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Air has less heat capacity than the walls of the refrigerator and its contents. Quickly opening the door allows the air to escape but the walls and contents retain their temperature. When the door is closed, the pump turns on to remove any heated air that entered. B will be slightly better but it will be a very small effect, possibly not easily measurable"

This is obviously a thought experiment (not really, it's for DnD) so ignore the practicality of the question please! Cows are spherical.  Imagine a ten-foot-diameter, perfectly round hole suddenly opened all the way through the crust to reach the mantle. The intervening solid matter is completely removed and replaced at once with the same volume of air.  Would the pressure of the molten rock and metal in the mantle be strong enough to force it all the way through the hole to the surface before it cooled too much or the hole collapsed? If so, how much of a geyser would it make? If not, how wide does the hole need to be for that to happen?  What would happen?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The Earth is not a gigantic pressurized vessel with the crust acting as a container.  It's just a blob of stuff held together by it's own gravity, and the crust is floating on it since it's less dense.  The overall effect of removing something that's floating on a liquid, or poking a hole into it, is... nothing, really.  My thought is that as soon as your hole appears, if it doesn't immediately collapse under the lateral pressure, the magma surface exposed to air will rapidly start cooling.  You may get some steam out of the hole but the mantle is a loooooong way down, so that probably wouldn't even make it to the surface.  I'm sure this isn't nearly as spectacular as what you want/expect, but as you said, you're in a fantasy setting.  Real rules don't apply."

The reason I specify European programs is because I think that the requirements for US PhDs (not sure about other countries) are a bit more vague.   My funding runs out in just over 3 months, and I've published more than the paper minimum needed to defend. However, I'm wondering if supervisors can prevent students from defending anyway if they feel that they haven't done enough work or if they feel the student hasn't mastered a certain subject.  My supervisors have been pretty vocal about the fact that I haven't done enough work for the PhD, which I feel is unfair for a number of reasons. Also, while editing a paper of mine recently, it became crystal clear to my supervisors and me that I am missing some pretty fundamental knowledge relating to my field (it's just not an aspect that I've focused on during my work).

I have made lemon squares twice in my life (both times from the same New York Times Cooking recipe, written by Susan Mahnke Peery) and have had the same issue each time. I pre-bake the shortbread crust, then pour the lemon/egg mixture on top and bake at 350 for 20 minutes. I take the pan out of the oven, and just like with the time before, I have a thin layer of baked egg on top of the lemon curd. It’s like I’m living in some sort of dessert-based, Groundhog Day nightmare. In retrospect, I don’t know why I thought following the same recipe identically on two separate occasions would give me different results. What was it that Einstein said about insanity?  At any rate, can anyone more experienced than me tell me what went wrong? I love baking but have no real skill or instincts for it, so I always follow recipes meticulously. I know it wasn’t an issue with me mixing up the instructions or anything like that. My uneducated guess is that maybe the temperature was too hot, but a) the recipe has great reviews from everyone else, and b) 20 minutes at 350 doesn’t seem outside of the normal range for lemon squares. I also have no reason to believe my oven runs hot.  Although I will almost certainly never attempt to bake lemon squares ever again as long as I live, my curiosity has gotten the best of me.

    "sft_answer": "Others have suggested that you might not be mixing the filling well enough, but you also want to make sure not to beat it too vigorously and incorporate a bunch of air in to it. The bubbles will rise to the surface during baking and create sort of a meringue-like layer on top. I would also let the crust cool for a few minutes before pouring in the filling. You might be getting a layer of cooked eggs when it hits the crust that then rises to the top."

Hydraulic press channel just posted this video on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69fr5bNiEfc, where he claims to break a diamond with his hydraulic press. I thought that diamonds were unbreakable, is this simply not true?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The problem is hardness doesn't mean what you think it means. Usually when we talk about hardness we are talking about scratch hardness, so that a harder material can scratch a softer material. This is a complicated property of the material, which you can tell by the fact that we measure hardness in dimensionless scales, i.e. we only measure the hardness relative to other objects rather than defining it with a real unit. So let's actually get away from hardness and talk about some properties that are more quantifiable.  A concept related to hardness is stiffness, which we can measure as the Young's modulus of a material and it has units of pressure. We can measure the stiffness by plotting the stress vs. strain for a material. A stiff material has a very high slope on a stress-strain curve. By this measure, diamond has a very high slope (Young's modulus), about 5-6 times as high as steel.   So why does the diamond break before the steel does? Because it is brittle. Although it doesn't deform much in response to strain initially, once a rupture starts it spreads and the diamond cleaves. Steel may be softer, but it is also ductile. Think of a sheet of paper vs a rubber sheet: the paper doesn't stretch as much but it is much easier to tear apart.  So the steel deforms a little more at first, but eventually the diamond shatters first."

    "sft_question": "Question: Property law: my mom is being sued by the guy who bought her house from the guy who bought her house South Dakota. My dad owned the same house for over 40 years. He owned it before he married my mom and she inherited it when he died. A few years after he died, she decided to move to where my sister lives and put the house up for sale.  Guy suing (calling him A-hole1) is a complete psychopath who has lived in the neighborhood 20+ years and everyone hates him. There are a thousand things we could talk about with him but the important bits are he’s a lawyer (not actually practicing) and a doctor (who lost privileges at the local hospital for being a psychotic asshole but not his license somehow and is still in private practice). So, he’s got a shitload of money and knows the law and also has bought up pretty much every other lawyer in town.  He’s also been methodically buying up every property he can in my mom’s neighborhood and turning them into rentals, subdividing lots and building more rentals, and basically doing his best to take over and ruin what was some very premium real estate right next to a national park.  When my mom’s house went up for sale, he immediately showed up on her doorstep (literally a couple of hours after it posted), and offered her her asking price in cash. She told him she’d think about it, because it freaked her out and she didn’t know quite what to do, and she said he was visibly pissed when he left.   My mom isn’t stupid, but she has never bought or sold a property in her entire life, so she relied heavily on her realtor. The realtor told her she could definitely wait on A-hole1’s offer and see if anyone else wanted to go higher. She then got a higher offer and took it—but, rather mysteriously, that offer fell through under some weird circumstances and my mom didn’t have a buyer anymore. She had closed on her new house already, so she was even more freaked out and wanted to hurry up and sell even though my sister and I told her to calm down and wait.  She then got an offer from a guy who’s a lawyer and on the city council (A-hole2). It was for more than her asking price, and *he waived an inspection and a survey* and just bought the place. So my mom took it and moved.  Now, the trouble comes from a detached garage my dad had built. He owned several acres so there were lots of spots to build this thing, but he decided to put it off the end of the driveway. He had a professional contractor come build it, and while my mom had almost no input, she says a survey was done it make sure it was far enough from the neighbors’ property to be okay.   The properties have no distinct borders; it’s just a big meadow, no fence line or obvious markers. Also the neighbors are life-long friends of my parents so if there had been an issue it would have probably been easy to solve. Apparently the garage is a tiny bit too close to the property line, like less than a foot (and this is a thing I do not fully get, because it’s a building next to an open meadow sooooo it’s not encroaching on anything, and we don’t have to cross the property line to access it).   But my mom had no idea about that, and presumably neither did my dad. My dad’s terminal illness did affect his brain and he did definitely make some bad choices before he was declared incompetent legally, so it’s possible this was one of them. But given the timing, I don’t think so.  Anyway, this no-inspection, no-survey sale goes through, and a little while after that my mom got an email from A-hole1. Turns out, A-hole2 bought the place from my mom, but had been in cahoots with A-hole1 all along. *He’d purchased the house just to turn around and deed it to his buddy A-hole1.*  A-hole1 then did the survey, and then found out about the garage problem. He told my elderly, widowed mom that she’d lied intentionally about it, and unless she paid him $50k to tear down the garage and move it(which cost $12k to build four years prior), he’d sue her. He also claimed her realtor had sworn on a stack of bibles there was nothing to worry about and that’s why A-hole2 hadn’t done the survey.  She got a lawyer, and got a confession from A-hole1’s lawyer that they knew she hadn’t been dishonest and they just hoped she’d “pitch in” to move the garage like she’d just be a good sport after the bullshit he had put her through (and his track record of being a psycho neighbor from hell).  So, original thing got dropped. But now, months later, A-hole1 is trying the same thing again.   My mom got a summons served to her new house; again she’s elderly and by herself most of the time (other than her giant-ass Rottweiler she can’t control and that’s another topic) so she doesn’t ever just open the door.   She saw a strange person on her doorstep using her doorbell camera, and talked to the person through the mic.  Person said they were serving her and she needed to open the door. Of course that freaked her out and she didn’t; she told the person she didn’t know who they were and she wanted to talk to her lawyer first. That person cussed her out and just left. All this was captured on the camera.  My mom’s original lawyer bowed out because his partner had just (*coincidentally*\\s) been bought out by A-hole1. She had to try super hard to find a lawyer after that and ended up with someone literally across the state because he’s bought every firm on this side.  So… my mom is being targeted by a fucking psychopath who did not actually buy her house, but got it through a straw purchase. He would totally would ruin her financially just because she spited him by not taking his first offer.   How worried should she be? How can I help her?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I'm not a lawyer but it might help to get a Power of Attorney set up so you can act on your mom's behalf in this matter.

    "sft_question": "Question: Neighbor is claiming they have an easement through my uncle's property. US/Ohio  Hello. I was hoping that someone may be able to advise me on easement laws in Ohio.  My great uncle has owned his property in Ohio for nearly 40 years. It was purchased from another family member.   Recently the family who owns the large wooded property behind my Uncle’s house have been approaching him saying that they have a 50 feet wide easement through his property. My uncle is very upset about this. These people have been very rude to both him and his wife. The part of his property they are claiming to be entitled to, has a large garden, well and other buildings on it.  I’ve not been able to find any detail about such an easement on the deed. It just says “the tract as surveys contains X acres, more or less, and is subject to all legal highways and easements of record.”  \\-Where can I find these “easements of record”?   \\-Also, 50 feet wide also seems oversized for an easement. I always thought easements were the width of a vehicle with a couple feet on each side???  \\-The family claiming to have an easement did not own that land when my uncle purchased his property. Their property is also not landlocked, as part of it runs along the road.  \\-The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.   \\-My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property. There is no easement described on the survey.  I’ve already advised my uncle to find a real estate attorney. He’s elderly and I’m trying to help him solve this problem. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. I do not practice in Ohio.  As a previous poster says the easement should be on record with the county recorder's office. However, It should have been conveyed to your uncle with a deed and likely should have been recorded if you have had a recent survey. Typically, in my jurisdiction, they research these things as part of creating the final documents. But this does not mean they can't make mistakes and miss these things. But they tend to be pretty reliable. This is what they do for a living after all.  So, new advice. First, I would not immediately believe a neighbor. While your deed says \"is subject to all legal highways and easements of record\", this does not mean there IS an easement. This is language to convey to the buyer that your are purchasing only what I, the Seller, have the rights to sell to you. It's a catch-all phrase so the Buyer knows there might be something you should have discovered when you bought this land that we didn't discuss at the time of sale.  Second, an easement does not grant universal access to something. Typically, they are crafted as small as is reasonable for the purposes. For example, if you share a common driveway, the easement would grant them access to regularly trespass over your land using the driveway. If you share a common utility hook up like a water main or sewage, it would grant them use and right to invade to repair it, but it wouldn't give them the right to regularly drive their car over the same property. So just because there is an easement, doesn't tell you what it gives them the right to do.  Third, an easement can expire. You can grant someone an easement for a term period. For example, you might grant someone an easement for a year so they can go over your property to build their house. Typically, you might see this in a subdivision where they might build houses in phases. In this case, typically the developer who owns all the lots and sells one and knows they will need to access it later while building on the adjacent property.  You might grant an easement for a period because they haven't complete their own egress from the property and you provide an easier access for a short period. So the language might terminate it naturally. In this case, if the language in the easement does not a have a termination date or set out a specific length, it is usually assumed to be perpetual.  Forth, an easement can be terminated by a change of conditions. For example, the easement says the person can run their water access until such time as they make repairs to the property. The point is that there could be a triggering event that ends the easement. Like above, it would only expire if there is specific language in the easement.   Fifth,I would not presume anything. I don't necessarily agree with one of the posters that this falls on your uncle to discover. While your uncle risks conflict and potential liability if there is an easement. Given there is a survey and a normal closing where it should have been discovered, he should feel comfortable excluding them from the property until they can show he is wrong. It would be in his best interest to call the county recorder and do a little research. But I do not feel he needs to go to extraordinary means to find out if something does not exist.  The thing about property is that almost all (really all but there might be some weird reason in your jurisdiction) of the time actions involving property have to be in writing and they have to be recorded for them to be valid. This is to avoid exactly this situation. People can make a promise a lot of times. They can write even a note or contract that grants someone access. But because any owner of land only owns it temporarily and the land exists forever, in order to bind someone to a forever agreement, that agreement should be fair for everyone to discover who might be bound by that agreement. Even if your great-grandfather wasn't born at the time of the agreement. So if it's not in writing at the recorders office, the easement doesn't exist.  Finally, there might be some minor really detail issues like adverse possession and prescriptive easement that might click in here. But really, these might be something you ask your attorney if this escalates and are very fact specific.  And that leads to my parting advice. If this escalates, have your uncle get a land use attorney for this issue. While most lawyers will know how to deal with the normal stuff, a land use lawyer really will know how to navigate it much more effective. These guys typically have specific local knowledge that makes them worth it.  I hope this helps and adds to the good advice of others here.  Good luck!"

    "sft_answer": "I'm a MechE, but I work with several BMEs in medical device research and development. We work with design partners on new autoinjectors. Right now they are testing different lengths and diameters of needles on swine to determine which needles perform the best with the least amount of skin irritation. Cold vs. room temp injections also cause different levels of pain, so they are working with our human factors org to create instructions for use to mitigate the risk. They also perform a lot of design verification testing (like total cycle time) and analyze the data. Report generation and documentation is a large chunk of their workload. Also, creating AFMEAs with support crime medical and human factors is an important part of their job. The regulatory agencies will audit those to see how the risks were addressed."

    "sft_question": "Question: City notified me that my property will go from “single family residential” to “open space” in the new land use map I have a small parcel of land by a lake in Fort Worth TX. It’s part of a split lot next to my primary home but is across the street and technically has a different address. Before I moved in the land was mostly overgrown and undeveloped, but I have since done significant work to make it into a nice lake front property with a dock and everything. The other day I got a notice that my property is in a 100 year floodplain (which I knew about from closing docs) and as such will be changed over to vacant/ag land in the future land use map. However, every lake front property is in the floodplain but only my and my neighbors property are proposed to change. The city also was being very dodgy about what “open space” means. I’m wondering if anyone has any experience with this type of thing - I know the city can use eminent domain if they want the land but I don’t understand why they would be doing this.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Long time lurker and first time commenter here. I’m a civil engineer in land development here. It sounds like the city is changing or updating their comprehensive plan. Future land use maps are a part of the comp plan outlining what use(es) are generally allowed in specific areas in their municipality. Land uses typically allow certain zoning classifications which in turn, permit specific uses. I suspect by changing your lot from a residential land use to open space, it will severely limit what you can build/get permitted on your lot should you choose to try and build something in the future. The fact that your lot is in a floodplain shouldn’t condemn your lot entirely as there are ways to flood proof structures and plan around floodplain, limiting the impact to the area. I would highly recommend speaking with a local land use attorney and/or eminent domain attorney to see what your rights are and what options can be available to you."

A social construct is a shared assumption about reality, not an evidence-based observation. Therefore, no one can be right or wrong on their opinion on gender. If someone comes to you and says \"gender is a spectrum\", all you would have to say is \"actually, under the social construct I operate under, gender is dichotomous,\" and that would be the end of the discussion since there is no objective way to judge these interpretations as true or untrue.   What could change my mind is: assuming gender *is* a social construct, any fact-based evidence that supports one interpretation of gender and no others.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "There's  a bit of an empistemological issue with this kind of view, which is that everything which we think of as \"factual\" is also a shared assumption.  That kind of stuff comes up in the \"we're living in a simulation\" claims that had a rash of popularity recently, but goes back at least as far as the allegory of the cave.  So, if you want to see people make arguments about how something is \"factual\" rather than \"shared assumption\" you'll have to provide some more specific guidelines about how you want to distinguish fact from shared assumption.  Now, you can't categorically eliminate \"all but one\" scheme for gender, but there are certainly people with particular ideas about gender that don't match up with falsifiable observations.  For example, there's the people who claim that there's no difference between men and women's brains or that it's impossible to distinguish male from female human tissue with a microscope.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_dimorphic_nucleus  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barr_body"

Super cool research, not many places that do this type of work, great people, gives me the opportunity to develop my skills in an area adjacent to my PhD. I'm grateful for the offer, especially when I didn't think I had a chance when I first applied.   But man am I dragging my feet on signing the paperwork. The 'salary' is so depressing, so it's hard to formally accept and officially close the door on the idea I'll find a position that makes good money right out of my PhD.   I'd love to hear stories from people who did postdocs and had a great experience/felt it was truly worthwhile!

    "sft_answer": "I haven't started a postdoc, but am actually seriously considering it after a short stint in industry. Industry definitely has its perks - the vastly better pay, generally better work life balance, more diversity of options. But honestly, coming out of my PhD, it was relatively....boring. The overall premise of the company was definitely interesting, but as an individual scientist within, it very much just felt like a job. There is a certain spark about academic research that can get buried by the more realistic practicalities of an actual industry role. I miss the constant stream of new people you meet daily through seminars, etc, I miss just trying random things in lab I was curious about without having to ask a chain of command for permission, I miss the high level science convos, I miss the level of personal investment I had in my work.   I have a potential postdoc opportunity in front of me - with a dream PI - and am feeling stronger about taking it by the day. One of the motivations, to be fair, is to keep the door open for a TT position and stay in academia permanently. I know the likelihood is that I'll end up back in industry, so I do wonder what the point would be, if ultimately, I just end up back at the same place anyway.   People generally don't regret transitioning from academia to industry - lifestyle and salary-wise, it's very attractive. But, if you're like me and had a pretty good, fun PhD experience, industry can feel less stimulating at times. Big picture - industry is working on big impactful problems with lots of resources, but as an individual, sometimes you feel a bit walled in on your day-to-day work.   Just depends on what you're looking for at your stage in life. I don't necessarily strive to retire early nor really have expensive tastes in life, so I have a bit more tolerance than the average person to make the financially disastrous choice of leaving a 6 figure job for a postdoc."

Firstly, planned obsolescence is different to using poor quality components materials for cost saving. Planned obsolescence (P.O) is deliberately including design flaws to ensure a product stops working or has reduced performance after a certain amount of time. It does not include items that need to stop working for safety reasons such as an expired gas detector.   As an example, there are two very similar phones that cost $500 each, one has a P.O date of 2 years, and the other has a P.O date of 5 years.  As each phone gets nearer to it’s P.O date it’s value approaches zero, so after 1 year the first phone is worth less than the second. The second phone represents a better investment.   It’s not possible for consumers to make the best decision for their financial circumstances without knowing the P.O date and the manufacturer should have to disclose it.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I really want to agree with you, but planned obsolescence does not actually follow the logic of \"this phone *must break* in 2 years\". It follows the logic of \"we don't care if this phone *only lasts* 2 years\". They don't intentionally design it to fail by a certain date (that's actually illegal), they just don't design it to last *beyond* a certain date and if it does, it's just a happy coincidence. They also ignore critical design flaws from time to time.  Planned obscelescence also revolves around making products difficult or prohibitively expensive to repair. For example, sealing the phone with glue, \"no user servicable parts\", \"warranty void if removed\"(also illegal but never really enforced), serializing chips, requiring custom proprietary tools for repairs, and only making parts/software available to OEM manufacturers. The legality of all this is currently being debated(look up louis rossman on Youtube)."

I am immensely interested in researching mental health/developmental disorders, as well as malignant brain development due to environmental stressors/trauma within marginalized communities. I have more specific research interests that I expressed in my personal statement as well, that I believe aligned with advisors I wanted to work with. I didn't apply to that many because I couldn't afford it and didn't qualify for the income waiver either that typically requires below poverty level indication.   I've been trying to find full-time research positions since I graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in Psychology from a small university and I have been applying to a variety of full-time research assistant/coordinator/manager positions (*all around the U.S.*) since I graduated and have only gotten rejections and no interviews, even for positions I was clearly qualified for. The people that I've known to get these type of positions always have had some kind of connection from the inside to get in, which I do not. I ended up taking a full-time management job in the private sector, whilst volunteering in a research lab part time (*this lab does not have any full time positions*).  I feel very stuck and discouraged especially as a BIPOC person, it seems like gatekeeping runs very deep in academia and full-time research/PhD opportunities for Psychology and Neuroscience are incredibly slim.   Any advice on the next steps I should take to increase my chances of getting into a PhD next cycle? I would also be open to applying to Cog Neuro Phd programs as well.   Thanks!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I'm in a department with a top-20 clinical psych program and we're disgustingly competitive even in a normal year (900 applicants for 9 spots). One of the girls in my year graduated with like a 4.0 from Harvard and still took 2 years off for a postbacc. This year they definitely had more applicants maybe like 50% more for the same number of spots. Neuroscience too has around 500 applicants to 10-15 spots and they probably also had a similar percent increase in the number of applicants.  What I'm saying is don't feel bad if you didn't make it anywhere this year (or any year in general). A postbacc is the norm these days but if this is something you truly want to do, it's not a big deal. I took four years off and I don't regret a second of it. It made me an enormously better neuroscientist and sometimes I think even 5 or 6 years off would've been better."

    "sft_question": "Question: How much harder do physics get in undergrad than high school? I wonder why many people take physics as hardest subject in my class.  Physics in high school is just finding upon what the required variable is proportional upon and adding a experimental constant to satisfy the equation and then few calculus and concept. And whole chapter we will be playing with that equation.  I am really conflicted which major should i choose in undergrad. Low salary as a physicist here in my country  is pushing me away from physics and towards CE.Money is not a problem for me but for my family i need to think of that as well :(   I wanted to how harder does physics get in high level.  Sometimes I think mixing up CE and physics as a dual degree.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "College physics has 3 distinct sections in my experience.  1st year, which is really only moderately harder than high school. You'll see derivatives, but probably no integrals.  2nd year is where you begin using integrals and stuff gets more challenging. If you are good at math, you'll have no real problems though.  3rd and 4th year is where you're now sometimes solving differential equations and using linear algebra techniques. These are the years that separate those who are capable of actually studying physics from those who can't. You can pass the courses while being in the latter group, but these are the ones that will inform your professors on if they can write a letter of recommendation for you for grad school (where everything is very quickly much harder)."

    "sft_question": "Question: Could an identical twin who recovered from an infection donate some of their T-cells to the other twin as a form of vaccine? Could this work with any two people? I assume it would work best with identical twins since their lymphocytes would be genetically identical.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The population of T cells in the body consists of a repertoire where individual cells have their own set of target antigens that they can recognize. This repertoire can consist of millions of distinct clones, some of which can be present in the peripheral blood at a frequency of 1 in a million or even lower.   For the scenario you're suggesting, you could sample bulk T cells from donor and transfer them to their twin without rejection or graft-versus-host, but if you are trying to endow immunity against a particular virus or something, it's very unlikely that any of the T cell clones your transfer will be relevant. You would need an intermediate step where you enrich for T cell clones with the right reactivities, or else engineer them into the cells, before you infuse them into a recipient.  This step of discovering reactive T cells that can be leveraged into fighting disease (either in the donor or in other people) is the area that I work in, and is a key area of research towards developing new types of treatments called adoptive T cell therapies. The vision is to do pretty much exactly what you're describing, but in a much more precise way: what we can do is take a patient's own T cells from a blood sample and select out the ones with reactivity to the appropriate targets or, alternatively, engineer them with a gene that allows them to recognize the appropriate targets, grow them into massive numbers in the lab, and then re-infuse them back into the patient (no twin required).  Right now, all this work is entirely focused on doing this to fight cancer. It's a really onerous process in terms of cell manufacturing and clinical infusion at the moment, which makes applying it to diseases other than cancer kind of difficult to justify.  So the tl;dr for the original question, it's theoretically possible, but practically not really. The right T cells out of the bulk population would need to be picked out in order to create a useful therapeutic or vaccine."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: There is no unified thing called Political Correctness, that we can get rid of. Often I come across arguments stating that we should get rid of political correctness. There is usually, but not always, a reference to Freedom of Speech and very often there is mention of the slippery slope that presumably comes with restricting speech in any way. I am having trouble taking this comments seriously because they seem to clearly be from people who feel like they are under attack somehow when a person disagrees with them.   I’ve come to believe that there is no substantial thing labeled Political Correctness that we have the power to get rid of. There is the reality that people can and often do make erroneous statements and naturally it doesn’t feel great when a belief you hold as true is challenged or even corrected.   Is there something off about this view?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The idea of political correctness first originated with the Nazi and Bolshevik governments in Europe in the interwar years, where \"political correctness\" means to hold opinions and views which adhere to those ones considered to be acceptable by the society. If we were to take this definition of political correctness then getting rid of it is not only possible but necessary for society to progress philosophically. But I think for the most part we're not talking about this classical definition which is essentially thought policing but rather the modern phenomenon.  If we are to talk about the modern form of political correctness, I would define it as mostly language-focused rather than thought focused. Most of what people call political correctness is avoiding using forms of expression which are considered to be derogatory towards groups which have been historically disadvantaged. Put simply, don't call minorities racial slurs, don't call autistic people retards etc.etc.  So I'll first make a argument for it being something we can get rid of. I'll begin by saying this won't be easy, since its not something physical which we can simply ban but rather something of a movement. However, it's not an overt movement like say second wave feminism or the civil rights movement but a more thought-based movement whose underlying goal is for everyone to behave in a politically correct way as outlined in my definition. So to get rid of it would essentially involve for a counter-movement to form against it, and point out its dangers (which I'll discuss later), eventually winning the debate in people's minds and thus people will stray away from political correctness.   Basically, right now most people are saying behaving and encouraging others to behave this way is good, how we get rid of it is behaving differently and spread convincing arguments about why behaving in such a way is bad. For a slightly extreme example, the anti-fascist movement in the UK before WW2 can be used as somewhat of an example, where people who feel that a dangerous idea is spreading come together and do something against it.  This isn't directly related but I'll also talk in brief about why I think it's good to fight against it. I think some people who first started the movement, primarily among educated young people, had good motives. Certainly we should try to not call people derogatory slurs. However, the movement has now expanded beyond trying to get people to not use them and into the realm of condemning anyone who does. This is dangerous since those slurs have been around for a long time, and its easy for people to use them since it has become a habit, especially among older people. Raising small issues to ridiculous levels, like implying that someone has deep rooted pro-slavery sentiments because they used a slur, will only make people resent it even more. Another reason is by shutting down people who are not perfectly politically correct it bars the lower levels of society from participating. While college educated people usually have a good grasp on things, those who are less fortunate sometimes won't, and assuming the worst of them because of a slip of the tongue  will not help society advance dialogue as a whole."

    "sft_answer": "To get nuclear fission you just need to assemble enough uranium and a moderator. Making a functional reactor is a bit more complicated than that, but getting a chain reaction running is relatively easy.  To get relevant amounts of nuclear fusion you need to heat the fuel to about 100 million degrees (Celsius or Kelvin, same thing on that scale). That's complicated, and it's far above the boiling point of any material, so you need to confine the plasma with magnets. That is complicated. Getting more energy out than you put in (for heating, running the magnets and so on) is very challenging."

    "sft_question": "Question: [NJ/PA] Just found out 5yr old son is not mine, have been paying child support Hello Reddit, I am posting this question for a friend who received the results of a \"peace of mind\" paternity test today.  Five years ago my friend received a phone call from a (newly) ex-girlfriend alerting to him that she was pregnant. Being a stand up guy the two got back together and tried to make the relationship work. They stayed together until the baby was born and later split up (within the first year). New Jersey handled the custody and child support hearings. About two years ago the mother moved to Pennsylvania without alerting the court.  Neither mother, nor my friend, live in New Jersey now and the case was never moved. My friend now lives in CA with his new wife and new born son.   Upon seeing his new born he had a gut feeling his 5 year old may not actually be his. On the advice of a lawyer he conducted the paternity test (called a \"peace of mind\" test) and learned he is not the father.   He is devastated but will be pursuing the removal of his name from the birth certificate and the termination of his child support payments.   He is wondering what he can expect through the courts. We've heard terrible stories of men who have been lied to about paternity being held responsible for continued child support payments because the courts like to keep a support system for the child.   The mother is a bit rough. Fresh neck tattoo, knuckle tatts, a single mother, but does have the support of a well-off family. My friend and his wife are living with her (his new wife's) family just trying to make ends meet with their own new child.   They will be hiring a lawyer but want to know what the first steps should be. Does he keep this a secret from the mother(is there a reason) or must he immediately state his findings? Are they in for a big fight (how expensive/experienced of a lawyer should he be looking to hire). Will the judge for sure order a court appointed paternity test based on his independent finding or could even that be denied? Any chance for repayment of the five years or child support payments? Any reason they should push for the case to be moved from NJ to PA?  Thanks for your help. If there are specific questions that I cannot answer I will get the answers directly from my friend. This is all very emotional for him but I fear time is of the essence.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "This is going to be very area/fact specific.  He needs a lawyer **Immediately**.  There have been numerous cases of courts deciding that the guy in your friend's position who have decided he needs to keep on paying child support, because the child would suffer in the absence of it.

Am I good leaving them to soak until then (currently 10pm) or should I try and cook them a lot sooner (11am-or noon) To be honest this is the first time I'm cooking with beans not in a can, so... Just put some urad dal and kidney beans to soak. Recipe said to add some baking soda and soak overnight but I kinda forgot to think of the timing. Am I good to leave these beans until I make dinner or should I use them earlier in the day?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I have started soaking (garbanzos in particular) for 24 hours if I can, adding beans + palmful of salt + decent pinch of baking soda to bowl and putting covered in fridge. I have been using fresh water + a bit more salt and baking soda for the cooking because I've heard the old water has farts in it.  Adding the baking soda is a trick I heard from Samin Nosrat. Supposedly the alkalinity mimics that in traditional clay cookware and makes the beans soft and smooth."

    "sft_question": "Question: Is it possible to overcream butter + sugar? I understanding overmixing cake batter causes gluten development, leading to the dense, gummy cakes we hate. However, is it possible to overcream butter + sugar? I always feel so scared of overcreaming that I believe lately I have actually been undercreaming instead.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Yes, but also no.   Yes because depending on the other ingredients and baking time you could be left with a cookie that is nothing like the intended final product. Whether it be over baked, collapsing, spreads too much… Introducing too much air to unrolled cookies isn’t really a big deal as they’ll just be more cakey than chewy although they’re more likely to burn on the bottom. For any rolled/cut cookie this can be a huge problem due to distortion.   No, because most people actually under-cream their base. This can lead to flat, underbaked and burned cookies. With ball dough recipes that’s a big problem as they don’t spread properly.   I’ve found the sweet spot for this is 7-8 minutes with white sugar and unsalted room temp butter. With any amount of brown sugar it’s 8-10 minutes. I let it go until the sugar is still a bit grainy, but it’s more dissolved than not."

    "sft_question": "Question: AITA for accidentally putting a hit out on my best friend, imprisoning my wife, and not giving my sons every little thing they want? I (40M) and my wife (51F) have four sons(18, 16, 15, and 7) and three daughters (17, 11, and 8). I also have a son (21M) from a previous relationship. My wife brought substantial property into our marriage, and I want to keep as much of it as possible.   Until recently, my best friend (51?M), business partner and all-around confidante and partner-in-crime, had gotten along great. And then I decided to promote him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, thinking that things would stay the same. He and I would be as thick as thieves, and we could effectively rule England, Normandy, Anjou, Brittany and Aquitaine together, and everything would be great! We had previously been working to acquire more land and income for the English crown by leaving bishoprics vacant and collecting on the revenues, but as soon as he was named Archbishop, was suddenly not on my side anymore. He suddenly wanted secular clerks tried in church courts instead of secular courts, and declared that funds I had given him AS A LOAN were actually GIFTS! This is someone I trusted! I trusted him to educate my son and heir!   I tried to let him off easy. When I summoned the Bishops to Clarendon, I tried to give him a way out, and let him compromise, but he refused. I was forced to point out that his own spending as Chancellor was completely contrary to his current position on clerical spending practices. He was okay with it before I promoted him! And now that I've given him the status and power I thought he wanted, he's using it against me!!!   So anyways, he fled to France because obviously he couldn't defend himself against me. Then he goes and starts excommunicating my other advisers and some of my other bishops! Then he wrote to the Pope and they threatened to place all of England under interdict! Imagine that, no weddings, no absolution, no burials... I couldn't have that, so I had to negotiate with the bloody coward. Then, as he's returning to England, he excommunicates MORE of my Bishops! I was at dinner when I heard, so I said to the room \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric!\"   Now, I was just angry. Anybody who knows me, knows that I can get angry and that I say things I don't mean. But four of my knights, some of whom had worked for my late brother (28M), whose marriage to the richest single girl in England had been blocked by this meddlesome priest, went to Canterbury and murdered the Archbishop! I didn't ORDER them to do it. I didn't hold a sword to their throat and make them go do it. But people are saying it's my fault!   Now, three years later, after I did my penance, I thought everything was alright. I met a hot, younger woman (25F) and have been seeing her on the side since my wife is getting on in years and spends most of her time at her summer house in the South with our second son (16M). Now, our eldest (18M) keeps begging me for some estates of his own to govern. But he's irresponsible with money, and would rather fight in tournaments than learn the business of ruling. And my mother always said it was better to keep your falcons begging for scraps than to keep them well fed. So I keep telling him no. His older half-brother (21M) doesn't ask for anything!   But then I hear he's run off to his mother's place, and that they're all on their way to Paris to meet with my eldest son's father-in-law (who also happens to by my wife's ex-husband) to plot a war against me! They say that I have forfeited the crown when I had the Archbishop of Canterbury murdered! Again, I didn't order it. Some of my men captured my wife, and I have her imprisoned to make sure my sons behave, but I hear they're taking up arms against me and several of my nobles are following suit.  Did I put a hit out on my best friend? Is my wife mad about the other woman? Should I have given into my sons' constant requests for money? AITA?   TL;DR: My best friend betrayed me, and I got angry. Some of my men killed him in my name. My wife and sons are rebelling. AITA?   Edit: Oh, I also just got a message saying that the King of Scotland is invading too, great.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "YTA Look, Thomas Becket warned you that if you appointed him Archbishop, you and he would become bitter enemies. You can't act surprised that what he predicted came true. And it makes sense. You were friends with Becket because he was extremely competent and good at his job. He wasn't going to accept a promotion and start being corrupt and bad at his job, now was he?   The way that power works is that you have to act in ways that consolidate your power. As Chancellor, palling with the king, eating drinking and making merry, and wielding an iron fist in a velvet glove made Becket powerful, and made you like to hang out with him. Archbishops don't consolidate their power by doing those things. They consolidate their power by advancing the goals of the church against the crown, being all pious and boring, and using the church monies and influence for the goals of the church. By installing Becket into the position of Archbishop, you stuck a knife into the heart of your friendship.  Also, look, dude, you're the king of England, not some hillbilly running a Tiger zoo. You have to be careful with what you say. Plenty of people will want to butter you up any way they can, and if you keep talking about wanting someone dead, that person is liable to wind up dead. At the end of the day, the buck stops at your throne, and you have to take responsibility for what happens in your kingdom.  And by the way, your wife is a boss. She responded to the King of France divorcing her by marrying his rival, the King of England, and bringing her properties to the English crown. Tread carefully there, because she does not play to lose."

Over the last 7 months, I have had a roll of customer prioritization; I fix one issue and headache only to move on to the next. Normal, but it's been \"This is now top priority\" from one to the next.  My most recent headache was just this morning, a customer being upset with a report regarding a product they tried to warranty. Long story short, it's not warranty. However, they emailed back within 24 hrs saying, paraphrasing here, that \"I (my company) continuously blame the end-user and one of the products was not even placed in service.\" Keep in mind, like any product, it can be screwed by customers prior to use. Also, this is literally the first return of 2 units within a 6 month period and they also claim they've had so many issues within the last 6 months.

    "sft_answer": "For the display itself, I believe there are all kinds of engineering involved. The base material, liquid crystal or LED part may need chemical, or material, or even physics background. Then you need electrical / electronic / computer engineering for the electrical signal to control and show picture on it. And you need mecahnical engineers to assemble the display panel and the circuit boards in a housing for the final product, make sure it is structural sound, does not bend etc. These are the degrees that I can think of for \"design engineers\" aka engineers creating the product. For design engineers I believe the work is half office work and half experimenting in the lab.   The above is only for the display. You mentioned a phone. A phone is not only a display, but a display plus a computer and communication device. Design engineers comprises mostly electrical and mechanical background plus computer science for software engineers."

Growing up I always thought America was the coolest and wanted to live there (based on American music, TV, movies, etc.) however now I’m older my view has changed a lot and this is no longer the case.  My stance is purely comparing America to my home country (Scotland).  I now believe America is capitalism gone wild, which is great if you’re rich and successful already, but if you’re not it’s a rigged system you’re unlikely to beat.  In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.  Regardless where you’re born (I was born somewhere between lower and middle class), you have the ability to succeed as medical bills or saving for a child’s education won’t bankrupt you, whereas in America that isn’t the case.  Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it’s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.  I believe this is, in part, what lead to the opioid crisis America is currently in.  Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.  Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.  Obviously America is a world super power and leads the way in a lot of things, but I believe as a random person of average health, average intelligence, and average income, if you were plucked out the air and dropped in either America or Scotland you’d have a much better chance of “freedom” (in terms of actual freedoms such as freedom from debt, freedom from incarceration, freedom to get educated, freedom to be healthy, etc.) in Scotland (or other similar western first world nations) than America.\nAnswer: ",

Maybe it has to do with the fact that it can be sold? Either way it goes, I think it should be legalized.\nAnswer: ",

On the other hand, marijuana is illegal and considered immoral by the general public despite it being generally considered safer.  The DEA reports 0 deaths per year from cannabis use alone compared to 88,000 from alcohol abuse and 480,000 from cigarettes.  Almost all of what I was taught regarding cannabis in the public school system growing up I later found out was misinformation designed to scare me and my peers away from using it.  I can’t for the life of me think of any reason for this substance specifically to still be treated this way.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "You wouldn't really expect that many direct weed deaths yet, because it's a lot more like tobacco... which is kind of a disaster that would have been nice to have nipped in the bud (if you'll pardon the expression) before it came to be so culturally ingrained.   And that's largely because of usage levels being low due to cost, illegality, and availability. If it weren't for vaping, I would expect vastly increased weed usage to result in the same kind of lung cancer deaths that tobacco causes (albeit fewer), because... frankly... why wouldn't it? Inhaling burning plants is why you get lung cancer (nicotine causes other problems) from smoking. It's just a bad idea.   And it's known to cause driving impairment, so expect to see some number of deaths there.   Also: second hand weed smoke is super obnoxious, and contact highs are a real thing... so I certainly hope that regulations prohibiting its use in public places continue to exist.   But Schedule I? Yeah, that's dumb and always has been. It should have been Schedule II at the highest, as it has clear medical uses."

The statistics of those getting into physics and ultimately doing research seem quite dismal from what I've heard. Is anyone here studying physics for other reasons and wouldn't mind sharing? I'd imagine going into industry is a common one. Or perhaps teaching?  Any snowflakes out there trying to create a youtube channel, or trying to become a \"gentle(wo)man scientist\" and do their own research self funded, or perhaps a software engineer that's trying to understand more and contribute on the side, or a medical researcher who wants to learn more about radiology for medical imaging?  It's a lot of fun for me personally and I'm genuinely curious enough to have math and physics fill my time. But as a 33 y/o dude, it's only been a hobby. I've been fortunate enough to become more financially independent through my software career but feeling like it's a bit unrealistic for me to get involved, esp. if it's getting a another bachelors in physics for $100k, then strive for a PhD for 5-7 years, then trying to get long term research positions. Seems like it would be a decade of sacrifice with very very low likelihoods of success throughout.   So what if there was another way to contribute meaningfully? Research would have been the holy grail for me and likely everyone else though. But maybe I could wrap my mind around it.

Of course what I tell people is how influential physics is going to be in the next century with quantum computing and fusion and space travel and how this is the most exciting field to be in.

I was thinking it may have something to do with neutralizing  the fat that drips down so it doesn't smoke/burn. I have some string beans in the fridge and about to cook some turkey thighs, any reason I couldn't use those instead of the standard misen poix?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Great answers here. I will add that personally I don’t find it worth it to cook a turkey with mirepoix. When I cook a turkey I will cut off the breasts and legs, brine them, pat dry/leave uncovered in the fridge for a few hours, then sear and finish in the oven. I like a cooling rack on a sheet pan to have air flow all around the meat. The pieces finish at different times so being able to have control of each piece is nice. It also drastically reduces the cooking time.  You can blend your brines - in a blender - with mirepoix to add a bit of aromatics to it. The blender also helps dissolving the salt/sugar without having to heat it. I’ve tried brines with all sorts of things and have had the best luck with; shallots, garlic, and hard herbs like rosemary and thyme. I find this will always give more flavor to the meat than roasting on a bed of veggies.   That being said. I will always roast mirepoix with the carcass for a stock to make gravy. A good stock takes time if I’m going to use the veg roasted with the meat for it, I’m not going to have time to really work the stock if the meat is already done. Obviously pour whatever juices are in the pan into the gravy.  If you wanna get really fancy you can make a butter/flour paste and rub it on the skin before you put it into the oven. I find this makes for a more “traditional” tasting roasted turkey. It will also make a bit of a roux in the drippings to help thicken the gravy, kind of sort of."

    "sft_answer": "Cats are wonderful and CAN be lower maintenance. They are often not as needy as dogs, and can be left alone for a bit. But some are going to be very emotionally needy and want to cuddle/hang out a lot, and others are independent. Additionally, lower maintenance does not mean they do not need regular vet care! They should go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup, and go to a vet if they are ever acting off.   Adopting an older cat will give you a better idea of their personality. A kitten can change a lot as far as their personality goes. I think the best thing to do would be to start with fostering for your local humane society or reputable shelter! That way you learn about cat care, get to experience different cats and which personalities work best for you, and it's low commitment. You could keep fostering if that satisfies you, or adopt a kitty after you figure out what you want!"

She was paid one week ago by a paper check which she then digitally deposited through her banking app. The check cleared and the amount was available to her, and she spent the money she normally would on bills and groceries etc. Then today she received notification of an overdraft in her account when there should have been plenty of money.

I receive a scholarship from my government to develop my project, which I received after proposing three main objectives, two of them a bit risky but were mangeable - before covid hit. Since the pandemic began, everything I do came to a complete standstill, as I have to work on the laboratory, which was closed for almost a full year. I have a salary until July of next year, but I don't know what I will do until then or even after.  My country (brazil) is in the middile of a 3rd wave, with a 4th wave incoming. My state's healthcare system has already collapsed. Me and the other laboratory members have, since past month, made an agenda where we have no more than 2 people at the same time (so everyone has exactly one day in the week to do their work), but we all know that if we were to catch covid, it's stay at home and hope you don't die, because there is no more oxygen, hospital beds, the medicines used are slowly ending as well, and no vaccination in sight for us (in the brightest scenario, late november to mid december)  My first objective has been completely cancelled, impossible to do until late 2022, because the facility has closed. The second one involves an experimental technique that we still haven't been able to finish developing (people involved have left the city/state due to covid, facilities are still not open, purchase of new chemical reagents has been slow because everything is out of stock). The third objective requires me travelling to another side of the country (about 10h by bus) and spend some weeks working in another laboratory, something that not only is not recommended to due in the midst of our health crisis, but also I do not feel comfortable in doing as my immune system sucks and I'm very prone to getting sick, which is why I have been in quarantine for as much as I can, only leaving home for the essentials (and more recently to work).  So there we have it. I don't have anything to continue with my original plans and objectives, I don't know if I have a story to tell with all the incomplete and broken data that I have, and I'm scared shitless of having to do a complete 180º on my project which, if it's not accepted by my funding agency, they have the right to cancel my scholarship and demand that I pay them back everything that they have given me, which I mostly ceratinly cannot do. Besides changing everything when I have about 14 to 15 months left on my PhD (after this time I will be without a scholarship, and I cannot survive here without it due to money reasons), the only alternative I see is to lengthen this PhD until god knows when, when I'm finally able to complete all three objectives.

You probably weren’t a strong candidate for ME as you ended up with what most entry level engineers in HCOL and even LCOL areas would consider on the low side.   You want to pivot to software as probably self taught and then expect to make the salaries you’re seeing simply because you believe there’s a lot of openings and they’ll throw money at you. What if you end up on the low end for that as well. The ceiling for software seems high because you’re selectively looking at desirable postings to support your current feelings. It’s also low for many people if you’re not at some top company or if you don’t continuously adapt and impress and play office politics just like any other job.   Can you guarantee you’ll make it to a top company and out perform all the other candidates that want those jobs. You like ME. Get another couple years of experience and bounce once you actually have an established skill set and can demand higher pay.  Only you can know for sure what your life goals are and what success will mean to you. Is the pay important because you want to retire as early as possible? Would you rather be doing something you actually enjoy that still pays well?

They just want to feel like oppressed victims. There I said it. As a man myself, I find this crap both sad and pathetic. This ain’t about morality or the right thing and most of the men up in arms over it are doing so because this is a chance to use the case as a cudgel to shut women up from speaking out about legitimate and valid issues they face in society *from men*. Be it lower pay, sexism, harassment, domestic abuse, stalking, or sexual assault.   A lot of men hear that and, rather then reflect on the issues women have brought forward, default to *”nOT AlL mEN”* or in this case *”MEn sUfFEr ToO!”*. Johnny depp isn’t the martyr men on this website make him out to be. He’s a screwed up, spoiled, crazy rich guy who entered into a toxic relationship with an equally crazy woman and they brought out the worst in each other.   Good lord, check out the witness testimony from Depp’s own former associates or friends. He was doing coke the night before taking his daughter to school. He threatened to kill himself and Amber Heard.   He’s a sad, broken down middle aged man that’s done bad things to his wife and had bad things done to him in return.

I'm not but many are, it's a simple fact, and it's sus you want that fact ignored.  Also Depp has issues so deserves it? Really?"

I've planted a tree which they rip the leaves off of to the point that they are killing multiple branches, they leave my yard filled with toys (multiple of which have been destroyed when I mow and hit them when they are hiding in the grass which is Great for my mower), and my wife caught them shooting off fireworks from our yard today. They get out my hose and play with it, and generally leave trash everywhere in my yard. I also have a fence up in my back yard and whenever I let my dogs out they taunt my dogs with sticks and won't leave them alone. I've called the police multiple times but they never do anything.   Ive talked with the guy who lives there and he doesn't care. He watches them do all this stuff and refuses to stop them.

    "sft_question": "Question: Why does a lot of Chinese restaurant pork taste so \"porky\"? I've noticed a lot of time when I order pork dishes from Chinese restaurants, the meat has an especially strong, robust pork flavor, which I love. Of all the pork I've ever bought in a grocery store, or pork dishes I've had from other types of restaurants, most of it is fairly bland and doesn't taste like much other than the seasoning or marinade/sauce it's cooked with.   I don't think this flavor is based on any particular seasoning, or a specific cut, because I've noticed it in everything ranging from pork belly to char siu to ground pork. I eat a lot of Chinese food and I'd say about 75% of the time the pork has some amount of this flavor, and it's stronger and more likely in very traditional and high-end restaurants. For instance, the other day I got some ma po tofu from a somewhat upscale, pricy Szechuan restaurant and the pork in it was incredible. Another place where the chef prides himself on doing thing in a very traditional way has this great flavor in all their pork.  I really have no idea what it is. A specific breed of pork? Some method of preparation before cooking? Aging? I'm at a loss. The couple times I've asked, they either don't understand what I'm asking due to language barrier, or just tell me they get their pork from a restaurant supplier, which doesn't help much since other restaurant pork doesn't have this flavor.  If anyone has experience in Chinese restaurants and may be able to shed some light on this, that'd be great.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: I think it is ridiculous that people and the media throw a fit when illegal immigrants are deported. As of late, many different stories have risen about immigrants, some of which have been in the United States a long time, are being deported. I read an article today about a man who called the police for help. Afterward, he was handed over to ICE.   Immigrating to the United States illegally is obviously a crime. Crimes have punishments/courses of actions that are clearly presented in laws. Deportation is often the punishment for illegal immigration.   People seem to think that because an illegal immigrant has been in the United States for many years, that them being deported is wrong. If it was a bank robber who was caught 10 years after the fact no one would be upset that he faces his punishment. So I don’t think people should be upset when illegal immigrants are deported regardless of how long they have been here.   Note: I realize that some people are brought here as children. That makes things more complicated since that is not really their fault that they were brought here. It is their parents or guardians that brought them here illegally. However, it is not the United States government’s fault that they were brought here illegally by someone and no blame or anger should be directed at the government and ICE agents for carrying out the law regardless if previous administrations enforced the law or not.   Maybe I am not seeing people’s issue with the situation. It could be that they are saddened that someone has to uproot their life, but if we look at my example of the bank robber, is he/she not also being uprooted from their life?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "> I read an article today about a man who called the police for help. Afterward, he was handed over to ICE.  I'm going to focus on this specific example, as the other commenters are taking a more broad approach.  Regardless of if you think we should do a more active job deporting immigrants, this is a particularly bad way to do it.  By setting precident that you can not get any help without likely being deported,  you are forcing these illegal immigrants to turn to alternative ways to resolve conflict.  Maybe they'll take the law into their own hand. Maybe they still need help, so they reach out to a local gang.  This goes further in that sometimes, law enforcement needs *their* help. If the only witness of a crime refuses to come forward because they know they'll get deported,  you're just impeding our justice system and hurting everyone *but* the immigrant."

    "sft_answer": "I was a PE in ChE, 14 years experience, and switched to patent law.  I made the change because at that time (early 90s) I thought OSHA and EPA were combining to push new petrochemical plants offshore, i.e., the Middle East.  I really liked construction management and with a family, I didn't want to move to Saudi Arabia.    In retrospect I didn't know how big of a risk I was taking.  I worked very hard in law school and got a couple of early breaks, and everything worked out.  One of the benefits I didn't expect is that our three daughters are themselves professionals (two attorneys and one oncologist), probably because of the example I gave.  If an engineer has unusually strong written and oral communication skills, along with good logic, then patent law may be a good path to provide greater long term job security and earnings.  Without excellent basic communications skills, law probably is not a good choice."

I've also used a very exotic board layer stackup while I didn't have to, because I wrongfully assumed it was common and readily available.

An event came up three days before my shift and we’re supposed to provide written notice seven days in advance for a shift that needs to be covered.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Mentioning gender is unnecessary in all but the most niche interactions and informing people of one's sex makes more sense To start with some definitions:   By gender, I mean the cultural identity that loosely related to sex as a concept, but is not inherently bound to it. I believe this understanding coincides with how businesses and the dictionary defines it, but I recognize I could be misinterpreting something.  In this case, by unnecessary I mean that it is almost wholly irrelevant to every situation and conversation I can think of.  The core reason I hold this belief is because any one gender does not inherently allow anyone to safely draw any other conclusions. I have known male-identifying gay friends and acquaintances who will often refer to each-other as she and are more comfortable with those pronouns (or at least, they appear to be;  when I asked there was a lot of good-natured teasing and very little by way of helpful education). This unreliability is, of course, far less prevalent in those that are culturally men and women (I have no idea what the gender version of \"biological male/female\" is), but when non-binary people are thrown into the mix, as I understand it one can't really derive anything specific about how one should treat them based on just that information.  Now, if there is no reliable conclusions to be drawn from gender, does that not make it a little pointless in all conversations not about gender itself? Wouldn't it simply be better to, instead of indicating one's gender on a form, simply leave it at jotting down one's pronouns? Also, since more and more forms seem to ask for gender instead of sex, isn't something being lost there?   As I see it, your landlord doesn't necessarily need to know a nebulous facet of your cultural identity, they need to know what to call you and what kind of hygiene needs you have. I can't think of what benefit knowing your gender would provide to a tinder date, as long as they know what to call you. Meanwhile, even as a bisexual myself, I still thoroughly appreciate knowing what's between someone's legs before a date for preparation purposes.   Even if mentioning one's sex is uncomfortable, wouldn't it be better to just leave the point unaddressed rather than use gender as an unreliable substitute?  If it helps, I'm coming from the perspective of a cisgendered man who has never been very active in LGBT spaces. As such, I fully realize I'm not exactly on the forefront of understanding in this field, and generally keep my opinions to myself. This has just always bugged me a little and I thought maybe I could learn where people are coming from.  Also, fair warning: I'm not 100% on how to award Deltas, so a little patience on that front would be greatly appreciated.\nAnswer: ",

I have a close friend who is a trans man who has fully transitioned and it would be incredibly weird and asshole-y of me to specifically say that he was assigned female if referring to him or introducing him, rather than saying \"this is Dave, he... xyz\".

    "sft_answer": "Let's start with the goals of the two different subject areas.   **Education** - The name might be a misnomer. K-12 education serves a few different purposes, but I'm not sure any of them are to prepare you for life. The first is to be a baby sitter. Are you really learning life lessons in first grade or kindergarten? No. You're in a safe place so that parents can go work during the day.   Another goal is socialization. K-12 education is meant to teach children to get along with strangers, respect authority figures, and learn to sit quietly and follow direction. This is really preparation for the work force where adults will need to sit quietly, follow directions, and get along with strangers.   The final goal is teaching children how to learn. For those that want to go on to higher education, they'll need to understand standardized tests and lecture. I don't recall a single thing learned in K-12, but I have definitely built off of those skills in college.   **Taxes, budgeting, emergency medical training** - Taxes and budgeting would be very difficult to teach to kids who have no idea what the value of a dollar is. Keep in mind, most kids in K-12 education have *never* worked a day in their lives. Their conception of money isn't quite matured until they work an 8 hour shift.   In a similar vein, I sincerely doubt that I would recall a single thing from my 12th grade taxes class and be able to apply it as a 26 year old doing my taxes for the first time. For most, their parents will claim them as a dependent until they're 26. That could be a *decade* after having taken the class.  Let's also keep in mind the stakes. If a teacher incorrectly describes the renaissance, no big deal. If a teacher incorrectly describes the method for saving a life? That could literally kill someone. Liability issues are springing to the foreground of my thoughts.   **Conclusion** - The goals of education aren't to prepare children for life. They're to keep them docile and behaved while parents work and/or to prepare them for higher education."

How can the empty space around the sun be millions of degrees hot and the surface only thousands ? it doesn't make any sense.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "There is strong evidence that the corona is really hot due to Alfvén waves. Alfvén waves is where magnetic waves are generated deeper into the sun and then transfer their energy into the corona (the gasses above the suns surface). Lots of energy from deeper into the sun gets dumped into comparitively few particles in the corona means that each individual particle will get a lot of energy.  20 years ago this was only theoretical, but since 2009 several probes (like SOHO, Parker probe and the Wind probe) have detected evidence that supports the Alfvén wave theory.  Note though that the corona being millions of degrees hot vs the surface of the sun being just a few thousand degrees hot is kind of like a 100 C sauna (feels hot, but you can sit in there for a while) vs 60 C water which will give you burns within 3 seconds."

If I had a 3kg mass a distance r from a 5kg mass, why is the force between them is ((3+3+3+3+3)*G)/r^2 ? Same goes to Coulomb's law, but with charges.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Note that it is only 3+3+3+3+3 due to your choice of units: In terms of grams, it would be a huge sum with 5000 terms (3000+3000+3000+...), and if you used units that don't evenly divide the kilogram, you wouldn't be able to write it down that way at all. So from that perspective, your whole premise is flawed.  However, there actually is some insight to be gained: Conceptually, you can divide any single mass into multiple smaller masses, each getting attracted individually. Forces are vectors that add linearly, and the total force will just be the sum of the forces on the individual parts. As any piece of mass from one body will attract any piece of mass from the other body, the total force ends up being proportional to the product of the masses."

However my baking knowledge is lackluster. So I tried googling and didn't find anything, which was not more of a bread texture. So is there anything with which I can replace sugar in recipes to get the same textures without making things overly sweet?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "As others have said, it’s difficult to copy the physical properties of sugar in a cake. It’s probably a better idea to try and mellow out the sweetness by adding some acid, salt, or umami to the cake.   Acid wise might be a bit difficult (as it would react with the baking soda) but you could maybe add some in the frosting (lemon cream cheese could go nicely). Salt is simple, just add a bit more than you would normally. Umami/savoy could be boosted by adding herbs, rosemary could work, although you obviously have to keep in mind the flavours that they would also add to the dish."

    "sft_question": "Question: (MN) My brother and his wife bought a house that was stolen (taken from someone through a forged quit claim deed) My brother and his wife bought a house 6 months ago. It has now come out that the person they bought it from wasn't the owner, her cousin was the owner and he forged a quit claim deed and had her evicted by the police. He then turned around and sold it to my brother and his wife.  They had no idea. They thought the sale was legitimate. They had a real estate agent and got the mortgage from the bank. They aren't bad people and have no interest in living in a house that was stolen from its rightful owner. She's been homeless for the last 7 months and was living on the streets and in shelters the last anyone knew.  So once she is found, what happens? My brother and his wife aren't going to fight with her, they just want to know what the process is and how they will get their down payment and stuff back. The cousin who did the forgery was arrested after trying this a second time with a stranger's house (thankfully he did not succeed) and that's how his lie about this house was caught. We just want some information on what happens next.\nAnswer: ",

They have the down payment+mortgage invested in the house, and, regardless of whether the guy committed fraud, the bank still gave him money and is going to want it back from the people who borrowed it (your brother). It sucks, but title insurance will help them settle this.   I feel like there is more to the story than this anyway. If the cousin took this to court to file an eviction, than the court has likely seen the title and found that it was valid. Be very careful that this isn't a scam itself happening."

    "sft_answer": "Good question. You gotta see which force is acting against that pressure. The telescope is not at the L2 exactly, but slightly \"before\" so it has the ever slightest tendency to get pulled towards the sun. This gravitational force is bigger than the solar wind pressure, so you need fuel to ever stay as close to L2 as possible, not overshot.   The aft momentum flap is to counteract rotation caused by the wind pressure, and not to act against the outward force of the wind pressure: the shield is rarely perpendicular to the sun rays, which causes a rotation as the sun beam is reflected off."

For example when you're breading proteins such as chicken or pork, do you season the flour or the panko? I've always just seasoned the flour but was curious to hear what other people do.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "It actually depends what flavor you want to hit the palette first. If you season the panko, you'll taste it immediately, right as you crunch into it. Otherwise, it'll be more in the background, and reveal itself as you chew. Moreover, the flavors will be altered by being deep fried in oil. The flour part of the breading won't be. Or, well, some of it probably will, but you get what I mean.  Anything you season the panko with will tend be less mellow, with the exception of cheese like parmesan which takes on very different flavors when subjected to high heat in oil. Your spices will be brighter, cheese earthier, herbs will get drowned out a bit.  ALSO keep in mind that if you season the flour, you're seasoning the panko from the inside out (albeit obviously less so than when you season it directly). When you season panko directly, you're seasoning your oil; in other words, wasting it.  I think generally you'll get better results doing the flour, or often better yet, the wet adhesive mixture (eggs, water/flour, etc) than the panko itself. But there are lots of times seasoning the panko directly is nice."

    "sft_question": "Question: Can someone explain contemporary race laws and race-based policies in North America (USA and Canada), such as affirmative action and tax exemption for native Americans? Why are these laws not considered racist/discriminatory? (Not intended to be inflammatory, respectful discussion please) I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, so please shoot me down if I'm ruining your wonderful sub (although if you could point me in the right direction first, I'd greatly appreciate it).  My question is not intended to be racist or inflammatory, and at the risk of sounding condescending I'd like to plead for discussion to be civil and for upvotes etc. to be alloted by reason rather than emotion. I'd also like to clarify that I am not North American, but recently visited a relative of mine in Canada and learnt, in broad strokes, about the race laws there. I'd like to share the experience as it adds context to my question; feel free to skip to the end to see my question on its own.  I visited my cousin when he got married in Toronto. He's white and Irish (1st gen immigrant), and his girlfriend is also white, originally from the Ukraine. They had lived there for about 10 years. She worked as a teacher on a Native American (or American Indian, I'm afraid I don't know what term is appropriate, apologies if I cause offense) reservation (I think she used a better name for it, apologies again). I was quite surprised by many things I learnt. According to her, many people in the native community are exempt from various taxes, and receive free education up to and including University (unlike other Canadians in that prefecture), and also benefit from various other favoritist policies based on race. However, to qualify for the full benefits (which could include ownership of land), you had to be at least n% American Indian - if your bloodline was too watered down, you no longer qualified.  I was quite surprised by this, because it didn't seem fair at all. First of all, there's something a bit grim about your birth (and your % indigenous blood) determining your relationship to the state etc.; I like to think that in a developed country, the law, rights, and duties should apply to all equally regardless of race. I was also distressed by my relative's reaction to my surprise. They reasoned that since they were white, it was fair - they'd oppressed the Indians in their own day, and it was time to pay reparations. However, this argument didn't make sense to me. First of all, many taxpayers (who are footing the bill for indigenous privilege) are non-white. They might be Japanese Canadians, who were hideously mistreated very recently, or just recent immigrants from China or Bangladesh who've never done anything wrong to the indigenous people. I also pointed out that a Ukrainian and an Irishman have also probably done nothing wrong (historically speaking) - heck, almost no-one suffered so much at the hands of the British as the Irish, and Ukraine hasn't exactly had a fun 150 years either. Finally, I pointed out that really, guilt shouldn't be inherited, and race laws don't really have a place in a first world country.  My relatives reaction is what surprised me the most, and what lead me to ask this question. They became very defensive and actually angry at me. I honestly felt as if they'd been brainwashed. I must admit, I don't understand the Canadian educational system at all, but it seems like it's trying to make people feel guilt - or worse, actually BE guilty - of crimes they have not committed. What is also strange is that they objected to my use of the term 'race law' in reference to laws which specifically stipulate different treatment by the law based on race.  I am given to understand that the USA has similar policies, for instance permitting Native Americans to circumvent various state and federal laws, again based on bloodline (Casinos spring to mind).  I was surprised to discover that Canada and the USA have different legal treatment for different races, and I have the impression that mainstream society doesn't question this much. Am I correct in that impression? What is the discussion in the field of social science of the validity of having 'preferred' races, 'tax exempt' races, etc.? Doesn't serious social science frown upon 'race' as a construct anyway, and if so, why hasn't that attitude permeated society as a whole? Finally, is opposing such policies considered racist?  TL;DR: Explain race laws in Canada and the USA, affirmative action, and social attitudes towards the same; please remain civil! (although obviously if you think I'm a monstrous racist, please tell me! I'm moving to the USA soon and want to be careful not to offend anyone in that country.)  PS: apologies for grammar problems, English is not my first language.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "On very basic terms the difference between Canadian and American Natives is that in Canada, from day one, they were negotiated with - NOT conquered. They have Treaties that were signed between their tribes and the Government of Canada which laid out both sides of the deal - what they got in exchange for moving to a designated area and completely changing their way of life. These are still legal documents just like a  Constitution - they are valid as long as 'rivers flow and grass grows'. At no point do the First Nations rights suddenly expire.   In America, this might have happened occasionally but American Indians fought back and were conquered. Agreements were made after the fact.   After those Treaties were signed, the problems have largely stemmed from interpretations. The Indians couldn't necessarily read, they have a different culture and different understanding. The translations were murky at best. The Indian Act is another factor which is where all the laws associated with Indian treatment are laid out. They are pretty harsh. While they may not have to pay income tax (while working on the reservation) they also cannot build their own house on that land, they are essentially rented. Any buildings or businesses need Indian Agent approval. Also look up Residential Schools.   Everyone who has immigrated to Canada since day 1 has come after it was already established by the Indians and Inuit. We are all living on their land (Turtle Island), according to signed legal documents, and everyone should respect that. Time doesn't erase everything.

    "sft_answer": "(For what it's worth, I wrote a Ph.D. dissertation on this topic.)  TL;DR: The most likely explanation is that the energy in the very strong magnetic field in the corona is being transformed into heat.  In plasmas like the solar corona, you can think of the magnetic fields (and the ionized gas, or plasma, attached to the fields) as being like elastic bands.  Convection  beneath the surface of the sun causes twisting of the magnetic field lines, building up stored energy. Eventually, in some regions of the corona, very large electrical currents are able to flow, leading to a rapid dissipation of the magnetic energy and a relaxation of the tension in the magnetic fields. This energy goes into heating the particles, leading to the hot corona. The corona is very tenuous, so it doesn't take a lot of heat to make the temperature much hotter than the underlying chromosphere and photosphere.  The specifics of how, why, and where the current flows are still not fully understood and this has motivated several recent space missions. Also, the process by which magnetic energy rapidly transforms into heat (the process of \"fast reconnection\") is an area of active and ongoing research."

And from human perspective, the monkey is a monkey because he behaves as a monkey. The key difference is that we literally “act” like monkeys, like an actor playing a role. But the “acting” implies we have an ability to orchestrate our meta-behaviors, whereas the monkeys are simply being.  Monkeys have a “goal” driven by Darwinian narratives, yet we humans have no real goal when considering the power we have to create goals.   I suppose an analogy would be the Tortoise and the Hare. Both are racers, but the Hare seems to be less of one because he has such great ability and is bound only by desires, but no real motivation to win.

So, in a vacuum when the inside of the suit is pressurized at 1 atm the situation is not at all different from the situation where the outside pressure is 1 atm and the inside is pressurized at 2 atm. Sure, in a microscopic level the two scenarios are not identical but at the macroscopic level it makes no difference. Therefore, you can test the suit for vacuum in normal atmospheric conditions by pressurizing the inside of the suit. You could even have a person inside since 1 atm overpressure corresponds to about 10 m water column, which, as divers have shown, is easily tolerated by humans."

However, they have all been proofread by my supervisor/co-authors, and significantly improved. In all cases of my writing, there were no severe coherence and cohesion issues. Mostly a suboptimal academic tone, and some unclarities (super long sentences). Anyway, I'm expected to submit my thesis in September. And i wonder what is the general consensus in academia regarding proofreading of a thesis by a third-party. My university policy allows it, and in fact some colleagues were required to do so by examining/ supervisory committee.    I'm not very happy with my writing skills. I tried taking some short online courses but I only improved marginally. My thesis is already completed and i began the polishing stage. There are no editing and style issues I'm very well familiar with the ACS style. It's just the language that I'm not very happy with.    What are your thoughts on this? I'm quite reluctant and feeling a bit guilty and embarrassed to seek for help in this.

    "sft_question": "Question: eli5: Sugars are carbs. What is different about sugar that requires it to be listed separately on a nutritionql label?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "**Explain like I'm five years old**: Carbs are a family that contains sugar but also complex carbs and fiber. Sugar content is the most important carb when making decisions about what is 'healthy' as it is linked to many diseases which is why its singled out.  **More in-depth**: Carbohydrates can be broadly divided into three groups: simple carbohydrates, complex carbohydrates, and fiber.  *Simple carbs* are mono- and disaccharides such as table sugar (sucrose which is glucose + fructose). These are absorbed quickly by your GI system and cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar which is accompanied by a rapid spike in your insulin levels to compensate. Regularly consuming foods high in simple carbs has been shown to lead to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other diseases. Having sugars listed on the labels (theoretically) allows consumers to make more informed choices on what they are putting in their bodies as sugar has been shown to have these negative effects.  *Complex carbs* are longer chain polysaccharides (literally many glucoses chained together) which take longer for your body to digest. This leads to a slow and steady increase in blood sugar and a slow and steady increase in insulin levels which can be well managed by your body. Foods high in complex carbs have actually been shown to be beneficial for people with type-2 diabetes (second link at the bottom).  *Fiber* is an insoluble form of carbohydrates that our bodies cannot process. Since it cannot be processed, it will never be absorbed or used as energy and will pass through our GI system. But it does play an important role in your GI health as it helps keep things moving and contributes to the feeling of being full.  There is a ton of misinformation about sugar including in this thread already so be vigilant about the information your read. One of my current pet peeves is defining sugars as \"natural\" or \"added\"/\"refined\". The source of the sugar doesn't make a difference in the chemical make up of it. Glucose is glucose is glucose. Orange juice that contains 100% natural sugars doesn't make it any healthier than orange juice that contains 100% added sugars. Harvard med wrote a great article about it here: https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/natural-and-added-sugars-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/  However, how the sugar is packaged is important: fruit mainly has intracellular sugar with vitamins, minerals, and fiber which limit the spike in blood sugar. Compare that to apple juice which has freely dissolved sugar (natural though!) and removed the fiber allowing for rapid absorption and spiking blood sugar.  **AHA recommendations on carbs:** https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/carbohydrates  **Harvard School of Public Health article on simple vs complex carbs:** https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/carbohydrates/carbohydrates-and-blood-sugar/  **STATpearls article on carbohydrates**: https://europepmc.org/article/NBK/nbk459280"

It is this sort of iterative work that slowly chips away at the unknown that is the backbone of science.   The household names in physics are responsible for big paradigm shifts in understanding, however we have to remember that these people stand on the shoulders of those who came before them.

From this recent thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/u68xuh/before_desegregation_did_people_believe_that/  > In the early colonial period, Protestants in America and Europe wondered whether race would even exist in Heaven.

How did that belief change into the modern view that people who die and go to heaven will stay in heaven eternally?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": ">How did that belief change into the modern view that people who die and go to heaven will stay in heaven eternally?  Both beliefs have existed simultaneously since ancient times and survive today. Let's start with a look into the origin of the former. When the Israelites were exiled from Palestine by Babylon in the 6th century BCE, returning to that land became a major theme in their scriptures. This is the purpose of Ezekiel's vision of the Valley Of Dry Bones, in which God shows the prophet many dead bodies being returned to their living state and explains that Israel will be restored just so.   After the exile, many exilic biblical passages were reinterpreted as Israel's historical context changed, and in the face of oppression many Jews began to view Ezekiel's vision as a prophecy of a literal, bodily resurrection at the end of time, divine justice for the suffering they faced in life. We see this view in the book of 2 Maccabees (which FYI isn't considered canon by protestants) written in the second century BCE. The author recounts the oppression the Jews faced under the brutal Antiochus Epiphanes, who outlawed Jewish practices under pain of death. In the story, a mother and her seven sons bravely choose to be burned alive rather than renounce their faith, comforted by the knowledge that they will be resurrected to eternal life while Antiochus and his men rot in the ground.   A few centuries later we see a retelling of the same event in the book of 4 Maccabees, but this time the family is reassured not that they will be bodily resurrected, but that their souls will be immediately gathered to God, and that  >We, through this severe suffering and endurance, shall have the prize of virtue and shall be with God, on whose account we suffer; but you, because of your bloodthirstiness toward us, will deservedly undergo from the divine justice eternal torment by fire. (4 Mac 9:8-9)  For this author it is the soul that matters rather than the body, and since God is eternal, so is his judgment, immediate and everlasting. (The irony of the influence of Platonic philosophy on this author's account of a resistance against Greek culture is apparently lost on him.)   The persecution under Antiochus is the same situation that gave rise to apocalyptic literature like the book of Daniel (2nd century BCE), in which the author assures his reader that God will send \"one like a son of man\" to bring divine destruction onto the ruler and usher in the bodily resurrection and judgment immediately after his death (Daniel 11:45-12:2). The early Christians adapted this framework to Jesus. They believed he was Daniel's \"son of man\" who intervened to conquer death and sin and that his resurrection was the \"first fruits\" of the general resurrection soon to come (1 Corinthians 15:20).  Many believers changed their minds from belief in the resurrection to the belief in immediate spiritual judgment simply because God's physical intervention into history (known as the Kingdom Of God) and ushering in of the resurrection never came. We can see this even in the gospel of Luke, when Jesus tells the man being crucified next to him \"today you will be with me in Paradise.\" The evangelist even tells his readers not to expect the Kingdom Of God to come, but rather know that it resides inside them (Luke 17:21). Compare this to the other gospels in which Jesus assures his followers that the earthly Kingdom Of God is soon to come indeed (Matthew 24:30-34).  Plenty of Christians today believe in a synthesis of both immediate spiritual judgment and a bodily resurrection at the end of time. This belief goes back to the book of 4 Ezra, in which the eponymous Israelite leader is told by an angel that spiritual torment and paradise begin immediately after death, but that there is also a coming bodily resurrection, at which point the righteous will enjoy everlasting life and the wicked will finally be destroyed forever.

We saw in WW2 what damage can be done when soldiers obey orders unquestioningly. For comparison: all US military members are brought up to date on their MMR (Measles Mumps Rubella) vaccines when they join up and they do not have a choice in the matter. I agree with this. These diseases are dangerous and damaging. The same cannot be said for Covid-19. The chances of a young healthy person dying of covid-19 is literally a few tenths of a percent. Young healthy people make up the large majority of military personnel. There is literally no argument that can be made that covid places the readiness and safety of the military in jeopardy; and therefore no arguement that can be made that to disobey the order to vaccinate places fellow soliders at risk.  Covid-19 vaccine mandates are about compliance, and nothing more. You need to ask yourself why you feel so strongly about young, healthy people at virtually no risk to covid getting a vaccine with no long term studies to prove it's efficacy and safety. You might just be a facist...."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Sitting during the National Anthem does not show disrespect to the military I’ve seen everyone saying how all the NFL players protesting are disrespecting our military and first responders by sitting for the National Anthem, and I don’t understand it.  How is sitting during the National Anthem showing disrespect to the military?   I completely understand how many are saying that is disrespectful to the flag and what it represents, but what about that makes it disrespectful to our military? In my opinion, it’s anything but disrespectful to the military because our military fight to preserve our democracy, and the freedom of speech is something that falls within democracy. The way I see it, they’re just expressing themselves in a way they see fit, whether it is effective or not.   Perhaps it would be different if I was part of a military family or if I was in the military, but I just don’t see the connection that many others are seeing, and I’d like to understand that point of view.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "\"Please rise and remove your hats as we honor our country in tonight's singing of our national anthem.\"  Nah, I think I'll kneel...  Deliberately not following instructions is disrespectful. Period.  More specifically in this context I believe it is disrespectful to both our country and military members. The flag is a symbol of our country's hardships and achievements, especially militarily. Listen to the words of the anthem. It was originally a poem written by Francis Scott Key after witnessing a battle during the War of 1812. The anthem and flag are a direct symbol of our country's military. When a soldier dies in battle, his/her coffin is wrapped in the flag. It's not just any old piece of cloth. It's a very powerful symbol to many people of this country, especially military members.  This being said, I do believe it is okay for these players to protest during the anthem. I don't agree with it, but they are allowed to do it. But just because you're allowed to do something doesn't mean you should. That's my point of view at least."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The Next 50 Years of Humanity Will Be Better Than the Previous 50 Years Nowadays, it's a pretty common opinion among younger millennials that the world is, to put it gently, fucked. Many of them hold the view that climate change will soon cause an irreversible decline in quality of life. Capitalism will continue to serve the interests of the rich and powerful while making it increasingly difficult for the lower and middle classes to afford life's necessities. And it will be nearly impossible, not to mention immoral, to raise and start a family in this messed up, increasingly unjust world.  I believe these naysayers have it backwards. Humanity is constantly progressing, and the next 50 years will be better—perhaps much better—than the last 50 years.   First, a few notes:  * As an American, I apologize for my primarily American-centric point of view. I believe my points generally hold true for humanity as a whole, but I am most knowledgeable about how these issues are playing out in American life, so I will primarily view them through that lens. * I am progressive/center-left in my politics. As my post is generally replying to the views of *other* progressives, it assumes that progressive policies are a good thing, and that, for the most part, the more progressive the policy the better. It's totally reasonable to disagree with my view on this, but I'm not really here to engage in a political debate of Left vs. Right. * How can you change my view? Just give me a solid argument that there's a significant likelihood of the next 50 years *not* being as good as the last 50. To do this, you should probably explain either (a) why I am wrong about the beneficial trends listed below, (b) why these trends are likely to reverse in the next 50 years, or (c) why these trends, good as they are, simply don't tell the whole story, and that other factors are simply bad enough to outweigh these positive trends.  Here are the five primary reasons for my view:  (1) **Social Progress.** Humanity's continuing social progress is undeniable. In the modern era, each succeeding generation has been more tolerant and accepting than the one before. Racial bigotry is still an enormous problem in our society, but it has been in rapid decline since the 1960s. Movements such as Black Lives Matter are gaining increasing acceptance, so much that they have now become mainstream (e.g., the George Floyd protests occurred nationwide, as opposed to being contained to a specific community). We scrutinize racial discrimination moreso today than at any point in history. No longer are we only concerned with *de jure* discrimination, but we examine and prosecute instances of *de facto* discrimination with increasing zealousness. Terms such as \"implicit\" and \"systemic\" racism are used by everyday people, which is certainly not the case in the past. Affirmative action has become a routine college admissions practice, and more and more people of color are being elected or appointed to political office.  This progress is not limited to racial issues. The LGBTQ+ movement has won widespread acceptance in at least some of its goals. Today, a same-sex couple has a constitutional right to marriage in all 50 of the United States. What's more, this sweeping change has been largely accepted by the vast swath of society—conservatives really no longer seriously contest this point. Mental health is no longer as much of a taboo and a stigma as it once was, and therapy is becoming normalized. Legal access to medical and recreational marijuana, among other drugs, is increasing each year. The #MeToo Movement has shed light on sexual assault and harassment in a way never seen before, holding many powerful men to account for perhaps the first time in their lives. Access to an abortion remains a constitutionally protected right, despite some attempts to limit or dismantle it, and the Democratic Party has becoming increasingly interested in ensuring legal access to abortions.  It's undeniable that the world of 2021 is a much more socially progressive place than the world of 1971. It seems inconceivable that this trend would not continue over the next 50 years, especially as younger generations age up and older generations, which often hold less-progressive social views, gradually die out.  (2) **Scientific and Medical Progress.** The COVID pandemic wrought unspeakable hardship on society, but it could have been so much worse if not for the miracle of modern medicine. We were able to quickly develop and approve a slate of vaccines to fight the disease. Today, little more than a year after the pandemic began in the United States, we now have more than 30% of the population with at least one dose of the vaccine, with millions more being vaccinated per day. This is a far cry from the unstoppable terrors of past pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu, which society simply had to wait out until the virus eventually \"burned itself out\" from the vast amounts of death and infection.  Modern medicine has allowed people today to live longer, healthier, more productive, and happier lives than at any point in human history.  We will continue to expand the mRNA technology used to develop some of the COVID vaccines. We will continue to pour billions of dollars into researching treatments for other diseases, such as cancer. We will continue to get better and better at fighting disease and pain. Science is amazing, and it will only continue to amaze us in the years to come.  (3) **Political Progress.** This point overlaps a bit with Point (1). Politicians today care more about equality and equity than those of generations past. Leftist ideas, like Medicare for All, free college, and the Green New Deal, would have been anathema just a few decades ago. Now they are supported by increasing numbers of Americans. The Overton Window is shifting, and it's shifting in a much more progressive direction. When Barack Obama ran for president in 2008, he did not support a nationwide right to same-sex marriage. But in 2020, Joe Biden—a seemingly more middle-of-the-road politician—does. Biden also supports a $15 minimum wage as well as enormous expansions of the welfare state and government programs in general.   With each new generation, ambitious progressive policies become increasingly attainable. At some point in the next 50 years, the United States will almost certainly have a more equitable and affordable healthcare system than it does today. It's really only a matter of time.   What's more, large scale wars have become a thing of the past. Because of (1) nuclear proliferation and mutually-assured destruction, (2) the increasing interconnectedness of global trade, and (3) American and NATO military supremacy, large nations just don't feel like fighting as many wars as they did in generations past. Combat deaths are decreasing, and so too are violent crime statistics. Despite a recent uptick during the pandemic, violent crime has been steadily decreasing throughout the United States with each passing decade. The upshot of all of this is that you are much less likely to die by violent means today than at any point in history. These trends will continue, and death by violence will be even more rare in 2071 than it is today.  (4) **Economic Progress.** Capitalism certainly has its downsides. It has made the rich even richer. But it has also made life much more affordable for the poor and downtrodden. Capitalism allows the formation of corporations of an enormous scale, like Amazon and Wal-Mart. These corporations are successful because they are able to undercut the prices of their competitors. Wal-Mart prices are dirt cheap, and their stores are found in many places across the United States, including in much poorer and/or rural communities that simply couldn't support a more expensive retailer like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, or Jewel-Osco. Yes, economies of scale make the people at the top much richer than they would otherwise be. But they serve enormous, and underrated, benefits to those with less means.  Additionally, capitalism has allowed the mass production of food the likes of which the world has never seen. Child hunger is in free fall. Industrialization is putting the worldwide poverty rate in freefall, as well. This process will only continue over the next 50 years, cutting poverty and hunger rates even further.  (5) **Overstating the Dangers Humanity Faces**. Now, to address climate change. Climate change is real, and its consequences are downright scary. But it is not the existential threat that those on the far left make it out to be. It is an enormous problem that will make life more difficult for many. But it is a problem that we can ameliorate to an extent that it does not severely threaten the quality of life of most people, even if we cannot entirely prevent it from occurring.  We're already seeing signs of this. The Paris Climate Accords of 2016 are a monument to how seriously world leaders are taking the issue, and how eager they are to fashion political solutions. Yes, the U.S. did briefly leave the Accords under the Trump administration, but the U.S. quickly re-entered under Biden.   Moreover, capitalism, the foe that made climate change as much of a threat as it is today, may actually save us from the monster it created. Green energy is becoming more and more profitable. Companies in various industries see a profit-making opportunity, and they are jumping on it. Car manufacturers are building more and more electric vehicles. More and more wind farms and solar panels are being constructed each and every year. The number of people employed in the \"green energy\" sector dwarfs the number employed in the fossil fuel industry. The transition away from oil is already well underway.  And even *if* we do no more to stop climate change than we are currently doing, I would argue that points (1) through (4) *still* outweigh any of the quality-of-life harms that climate change will cause in the next 50 years.   \\--------  In conclusion, I believe the next 50 years will proceed much as the last 50 years have, with humanity continuing its long history of gradual progress into a more beneficent worldwide community. The next 50 years will be better than the last 50 years. CMV.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: Apples n peanut butter So I'm sittin here at like 12:30 at night eatin some apples and peanut butter because that's the healthy choice, right? Well I notice something and I've noticed it before but always just brushed it off as one of those great life mysteries. So of course I cut my apples into slices, and I notice that it's pretty easy to scoop up the peanut butter, like the corner of the apple gets in there and just scoops real nice. But then, I wanna rescoop. And the edge is flat now because I bit it. And the peanut butter doesn't scoop. It just pushes the peanut butter around. Why? It's not like any property of either changed, except the edge is flat. Why doesn't the peanut butter just stick to the flat edge? I'm wondering if when I bite it, more juice comes out and that's creating like a barrier. I'm not sure.  My solution to this is just to turn the apple around to the other pointy edge, but the question is still there. What do flat edges have against peanut butter???\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I love this post lol  Some people in the thread seem to think that it's due to the moisture on the apple slice after you bite, but I don't think a bite would leave a significant amount of moisture, and apples are already pretty moist inside.  I think it's more likely due to a change in the geometry of the apple slices after you've taken a bite. Like I'm imagining you cut the apples into the little normal shaped slices, and grabbing up the peanut butter with a sharp edge of the slice, so it gets in there real good and nabs some sweet sweet peanut butter. It gets in deep because of the sharp edge, it creates more pressure causing the apple to penetrate deep into the peanut butter, so you can scoop it. But after you take a bite, you don't have as much of an edge, so the apple slice doesn't penetrate much into the peanut butter, so it can't get as much of a hold, so it just pushes it around.   If you want to test if it has anything to do with the moisture, and not the geometry like I think, you could try licking, but not biting, an apple slice and then trying to scoop. If it doesn't scoop, it's likely due to moisture. If it scoops just fine it's probably due to there being no edge."

    "sft_question": "Question: AITA for accidentally putting a hit out on my best friend, imprisoning my wife, and not giving my sons every little thing they want? I (40M) and my wife (51F) have four sons(18, 16, 15, and 7) and three daughters (17, 11, and 8). I also have a son (21M) from a previous relationship. My wife brought substantial property into our marriage, and I want to keep as much of it as possible.   Until recently, my best friend (51?M), business partner and all-around confidante and partner-in-crime, had gotten along great. And then I decided to promote him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, thinking that things would stay the same. He and I would be as thick as thieves, and we could effectively rule England, Normandy, Anjou, Brittany and Aquitaine together, and everything would be great! We had previously been working to acquire more land and income for the English crown by leaving bishoprics vacant and collecting on the revenues, but as soon as he was named Archbishop, was suddenly not on my side anymore. He suddenly wanted secular clerks tried in church courts instead of secular courts, and declared that funds I had given him AS A LOAN were actually GIFTS! This is someone I trusted! I trusted him to educate my son and heir!   I tried to let him off easy. When I summoned the Bishops to Clarendon, I tried to give him a way out, and let him compromise, but he refused. I was forced to point out that his own spending as Chancellor was completely contrary to his current position on clerical spending practices. He was okay with it before I promoted him! And now that I've given him the status and power I thought he wanted, he's using it against me!!!   So anyways, he fled to France because obviously he couldn't defend himself against me. Then he goes and starts excommunicating my other advisers and some of my other bishops! Then he wrote to the Pope and they threatened to place all of England under interdict! Imagine that, no weddings, no absolution, no burials... I couldn't have that, so I had to negotiate with the bloody coward. Then, as he's returning to England, he excommunicates MORE of my Bishops! I was at dinner when I heard, so I said to the room \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric!\"   Now, I was just angry. Anybody who knows me, knows that I can get angry and that I say things I don't mean. But four of my knights, some of whom had worked for my late brother (28M), whose marriage to the richest single girl in England had been blocked by this meddlesome priest, went to Canterbury and murdered the Archbishop! I didn't ORDER them to do it. I didn't hold a sword to their throat and make them go do it. But people are saying it's my fault!   Now, three years later, after I did my penance, I thought everything was alright. I met a hot, younger woman (25F) and have been seeing her on the side since my wife is getting on in years and spends most of her time at her summer house in the South with our second son (16M). Now, our eldest (18M) keeps begging me for some estates of his own to govern. But he's irresponsible with money, and would rather fight in tournaments than learn the business of ruling. And my mother always said it was better to keep your falcons begging for scraps than to keep them well fed. So I keep telling him no. His older half-brother (21M) doesn't ask for anything!   But then I hear he's run off to his mother's place, and that they're all on their way to Paris to meet with my eldest son's father-in-law (who also happens to by my wife's ex-husband) to plot a war against me! They say that I have forfeited the crown when I had the Archbishop of Canterbury murdered! Again, I didn't order it. Some of my men captured my wife, and I have her imprisoned to make sure my sons behave, but I hear they're taking up arms against me and several of my nobles are following suit.  Did I put a hit out on my best friend? Is my wife mad about the other woman? Should I have given into my sons' constant requests for money? AITA?   TL;DR: My best friend betrayed me, and I got angry.

    "sft_answer": "Cow manure is not the same thing as soil. Soil is dirt and cow manure is feces. People spread manure ON soil because as it breaks down it releases nutrients into the soil.  Deserts are made up of sand, not soil. Soil has an entire biome of bacteria, insects, and other microscopic creatures that are a part of it other than just the dirt itself.  Soil also has a fairly high moisture content compared to sand. Soil also has the roots of plants to help hold it in place.  Sand in a desert has no such structure of roots holding it in one place so it tends to blow around.   So if you put a ton of shit in the desert, it would just be shit in the desert. It wouldn’t transform into soil and would instead probably just dry out and stay there for a very long time since the micro biome that breaks down shit doesn’t exist in the desert."

I’ll add vinegar or lemon juice to make up for the acidic flavor wine would add if it needs it, but overall most recipes don’t actually need wine.

Honestly this is just a hobby for me, my day job pays way more than cooking ever could, and I don't feel I'm good enough to charge for the food anyway. So I intend for it to stay a hobby.   But... I really want access to that sweet sweet Callebaut coveture chocolate that the store sells, as well as a few other things I can't find anywhere else.   Why do these places only sell to other businesses? My money is just as green as everyone else's. Do I really need to file for a business license for this? This seems like overkill.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "If the store requires you to be a business so they don’t have to charge you sales tax, all the advice here encouraging you to set up a fake business to gain access is not good. The business should require you to provide your state reseller permit/certificate and if you use that intentionally for personal purchases you are asking the state to hit you with a big penalty. Just shop elsewhere. There are other options including restaurant supply stores open to the general public."

    "sft_question": "Question: Stalker installed a spy cam in my room Hi, I'm residing in Boston, MA.  I'm currently being stalked by someone and the stalker installed a spy cam in my room. The spy cam in question is about to be seized by law enforcement. Is it necessary for them to view the footage in order to press charges (this is most likely an IP cam and can be traced to the owner)?  If they do view the footage, there is a chance they might see me consume a substance that is decriminalized and legally acquired in Cambridge but illegal in Boston. The substance is not in my house and cannot be detected on a test- the only evidence of it is on video. The amount was very little and I doubt any video footage would be clear enough to indicate what it is (and it kinda looks like cannabis so I could just say its cannabis).\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: What are alternative career paths for a recent engineering graduate who's effectively unhireable as an engineer? Hola, amigos!  I just graduated from a top ten university with a degree in Chemical Engineering. Sounds great, right? Well...I graduated with a 2.21 gpa (2.43 major). Zero internship experience. Spent most of my semesters on academic probation. Took 6.5 years to graduate.  To be blunt, I'm not hireable. No company in the world could look at my academic record and choose to give me a shot. I know that, and I recognize that engineering simply isn't an option for me at this point.  With that said, what *are* the options for someone like me? I don't want to work a minimum-wage job the rest of my life, like I have been full-time since graduating, and I have to believe it's possible to find some job somewhere that I could be qualified for. Or become qualified for.  What should someone in a situation like mine do?*  I appreciate any and all insight.  *I don't want to make this question specific to me, but rather broadly applicable to anyone whose undergraduate experience was, to put it mildly, an unmitigated disaster. I'm happy to answer questions about my specific situation, but I want to keep the situation generalizable for everyone.   **Addendum:** I don't want to portray myself as completely hopeless. Yes, my overall gpa is dire, but the context is that I \"earned\" a 1.42 gpa during my freshman year, and subsequently took two years off to take community college courses before returning. With the exception of a semester that proved to be almost a total loss (1.37 gpa and two D's; I should have dropped out of classes before the deadline), I earned a 2.44 gpa or higher in my other 5 semesters, and a 2.82 and 3.20 in my final two semesters, respectively (while working 20+ hours per week during both semesters). So it's not a complete wash. But it's very hard to be optimistic... I have a friend who enjoyed a full ride, earned a 3.95 gpa, and worked multiple internships...and he applied to 60 jobs, with only 2 interviews!\nAnswer: ",

Suppose he had only ever heard a Swedish Death Metal album, seen paintings by HR Giger, or seen the movie The Room? How messed up would his understanding of Earth culture be, and how would this reflect on his strategies?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "It's worth pointing out that in the Star Wars universe planets tend to be more culturally homogeneous than Earth is. As an example, there are several traits that are often associated with Corellians, vs. Kuati, vs. the Naboo. That said, Thrawn was able to determine who the leaders were (and even when leadership changed mid-battle) and base his strategies around that, so I'd guess that if he wanted to invade Earth he'd specifically seek out art corresponding to the cultures of the commanders he thinks he'd face.  If Thrawn only had access to a few pieces of artwork I don't think he'd want to base a strategy around that - in Legends he's often protrayed with a ton more examples, so it'd make sense that he would need or want more artwork to search for his cultural insights. I think it's possible that he could be fooled if somehow he got access to a large amount of Earth artwork that was from the same culture without realizing it only represented one of the many Earth cultures, but at the same time his ability to analyze art is so good that he might be able to tell from that that there were other cultures he was missing."

    "sft_question": "Question: [Star Wars Canon/Legends] If for whatever reason the Emperor died at some point before Endor, the Empire would recognize Vader as the new Emperor or would fall apart entirely? Imagining the Emperor's death wasn't Vader's a coup/Vader is beyond suspicion as a traitor.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The Emperor himself would never willingly hand over the reins to anyone, his objective was immortality and the end of the Rule of Two by establishing himself as the eternal Sith. This idea is consistent in both Legends (Darth Plagueis novel) and Canon (Rebels, TRoS, Tarkin novel). One of the reasons he wanted someone as powerful as Anakin was to assist in the accomplishment of this either by using his power to help in the creation of the technique, or as a vessel to transfer to (this idea existed in the Darth Bane trilogy but I think was also part of the method involved in his Ep 9 clone-based return, though Obi-wan rather messed that plan up).  So for Palpatine, not dying was the primary idea, but if he did, coming back was always the plan, whether as a clone on Byss or Exegol. So whoever takes over the Empire is only a stopgap.  In Canon, Operation Cinder was instituted on the event of the Emperor's death essentially as a punishment for those who were supposed to serve and protect him for their failure (obv not just at Endor but leading up to it). The true successor to the Empire re-formed in the Unknown Regions as the First Order and would return to conquer the galaxy and the reborn Palpatine would take over at the head of a new Sith Empire once he'd figured out how to make the new body stick. Either Vader would have been let in on the deal as the one to lead the FO until then, or he'd have been cut out for failing to protect his master.  I think in both Canon and Legends, the way it plays out for the Empire left in the main galaxy would be the same. We see in the canon Vader comics a few cases where he has to deal with rivals for his status, as the Emperor was always testing potential replacements against him. Around the time of ANH, Vader was sort of an elite attack dog, crossed with the Wolf from Pulp Fiction, sent in to clean up other people's messes and handle Jedi that the inquisitors couldn't cope with. He deals with all of those rivals, so by the time of ESB he's undisputed second to Palpatine. In the event of Palpatine's death, all those who resented him would no doubt try to manipulate control and he'd have a few admirals and moffs to deal with (and all the warlords and loonies that feature in the Legends timeline), but ultimately I don't think there are any that could really cause a problem for Vader.  So in the end, Vader would top the tree of the Empire, having removed all rivals, through a mixture of brute force, Force power, and Anakin's tactical brilliance. I think the question that remains for speculation is whether, under Legends, he would've been able to maintain the level of control Palpatine did without Palpatine's battle meditation manipulation (and therefore how his Empire would have fared against the Yuuzhan Vong), and for Canon, whether he would've been beaten by the returning Sith Empire."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Everyone should be required to be an organ donor upon death. **1- WHY**- The reason why everyone should automatically be required to be an organ donor upon death is simple, after you die you don't need your organs, if you happen to die an unfortunate and untimely death with your organs still in good health save a life. It's selfish not to.  **2- WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELEIFS**- Does your religious beliefs also require you to not accept a donated organ and instead go to the afterlife? Or is this a case of My body is too sacred to save someone else, but someone else body can be used to save me!  If it's the former then fine you have a fair point and a consistent view that the body after death caries significance and thus should not be messed with. Thus you will follow that to your grave.  If its the later you have no standing, and your argument is full of crap, you can't have it both ways, either the body is important to the soul and thus must be left alone and so taking part of someone's body to heal yourself if sacrilegious or its not.  **3- PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN BODY**- Correct in life, not in death to value the dead over the living is immoral. To say that because you have died someone else should die is antithetical to the very notion of morality.  **4- SO YOU THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE BLOOD TOO?**- All able bodied healthy adults who can give blood should when called upon. If they have a shortage and need blood I see no reason not to go give a safe amount of blood. However since there is a LOT of red tape I kept this out of my over arching view.

    "sft_answer": "Theoretically this sounds great…save lives with something that has no further purpose…  In reality I believe making it mandatory for everyone to donate organs would also make it an expectation that each person would care for their organs in a way that would keep them in optimum condition.  A person who smokes or drinks would be accused of “selfishly ruining their lungs/liver, and not thinking about how important those are to save lives”…  It could (not saying it’s guaranteed to happen, just COULD)…become immoral/unethical to act in ANY way that reduces your organs health.  That eating sweets, not exercising regularly, or being “unhealthy” in ANY manner becomes socially “wrong” because your personal choices will reduce the chances of saving lives with your organs if you die in an accident…  Once you start insisting a person makes ONE choice to save others, like organ donation, it makes it easier to socially argue for other actions too…very slippery slope."

Along with my experience of people debating against universal healthcare, I'm also taking this list as a help: https://balancedpolitics.org/universal_health_care.htm  Let's play the devil's advocate here:  * If the government agencies are never efficient, we should let the free market save the flooded and bill the people rescued.  * Cost control of rescue missions will be better if the driving forces of the rescue operations are competition, innovation and profit motives.  * Patients should have a way to choose which treatment they can get according to what they can afford, and it should be the same for people in floods and rescue missions.  * Costs are increased when patients don't curb their doctor visits, and likewise they might not show restraint when asking for help from the rescue missions if they know they won't be billed for it afterwards.  * People who take care of themselves by doing sport, eating well and not living in areas liable to flooding should not have to pay the burden for the others.  * Government is likely to pass regulations against smoking, eating and not evacuating places with a tempest forecast, which will lead to a loss of personal freedoms.  **Clarification**: this looks like a \"double-standard\" question (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_double_standards), which are usually disallowed, so let me clarified my stance. I think arguments against universal healthcare don't make any sense and this is perfectly illustrated by natural disasters, as they can also apply but sound completely absurd. I'll consider my view changed if you are able to convince me that this analogy doesn't hold because there are deep and important reasons why saving people in Houston for free is more justified than having universal healthcare, from an anti-universal healthcare perspective.

    "sft_answer": "You're equating the wrong things. You're comparing short-term disaster relief to health care on every level.   It'd be one thing if you said, \"Free emergency department visits for real emergencies and medical bills over a certain threshold\", but you didn't.   Universal Health Care typically includes preventative care like physicals, planned medical expenses like childbirth, and other care for nonlethal ailments.   Disaster recovery compares much more to ER visits or serious illness treatments over a certain threshold.  Basically, UHC is a totally different animal than disaster relief.   Why should we save people in Houston for 'free'? Well, I'd point to the scale. If the government doesn't step in, America's fourth largest city will be economically broken for years. There is so much water and damage in the area that if we leave it alone, the American economy would break. If we don't get the people out before we start the cleanup and repairs, it will not only result in large numbers of human loss, but it will make cleanup and repair much more difficult and costly, as the area would likely become dangerous both biologically and criminally.  With the massive scale of Houston being the fourth largest city in America, even ignoring the damage to structures and buildings if we allow most of the people to die due to there being no disaster relief organization at the scale of the government. With those people dying, there will be a massive economic impact on the city of Houston, which will, in turn, have a widespread effect on the rest of the United States.  With Universal Health Care, the number of people who are affected is large, but how many actually die from not being able to afford treatment? According to this place it was at-most 45k in the early 2000s. Even if that number were to have doubled to 90k, it's still a very small number. On the other hand, if even if 10% of Houston's population needs saving, it dwarfs that 45k number."

    "sft_answer": "General tips:  -Don't grease anything but the very bottom of the pan. -make sure the butter isn't too hot -make sure milk isn't too cold -if they are whole eggs, you basically can't overmix, make sure they are thick, pale and significantly increased in size -if anything, oven temp should be hottest at the beginning, so I usually set iy to abt 10degrees higher and then place cake in, then turn temp down immediately. It basically makes sure that the oven temp is consistent as you open the oven door. -use room temp eggs to start."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered. One thing I will say isn’t going to change my mind: anecdotes of “my school already teaches this” unless you can show me that it’s already happening in a large number of schools.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Hey, A+ for getting a fresh topic Friday through.   However, one of the issues I can think of with doing this is that the statistics in a lot of scientific papers is more dense than most high schoolers would be able to interpret. Without a solid grounding in statistics then it is hard to understand if what the paper is telling you is truly profound. In fact, I have noticed a lot of pop science writing falls into this trap, they will release some grabbing headline about some study which is probably really impressive, but without really understanding the baselines at play things like \"44% more,\" or whatever are kind of meaningless.   Here is one good example, if you look up Harvard's gun violence research, which is well regarded - you will run into a stat that says something like \"A gun in the home increases the risk of dying by gunshot by 4x.\" OH MY GOSH! Right? Except, you don't know what the baseline is, which is miniscule when compared to the number of people and guns in the USA. 4x a small number is still a pretty small number. So what is your actual risk of death by gunshot, very low, what is it after you introduce a gun into the house - still extremely low."

    "sft_answer": "Hooray!  this is something I can answer.  Partially...  In Europe, it was still clocks, belltower clocks.  The reason that there were so many belltowers in cities hundreds of years ago was that you couldn't afford a clock and you still needed to be places at a certain time, work, meetings social arrangements, exact time was becoming an issue, so you had clocks with bells on them, directing the pace of the cities.  At the more significant times, often more bells would ring.  Bells would stay silent during general sleeping hours.  Source: Boorstien's The Discoverers.  The other big answer, when exact time was less important was sunlight.  Leave your shutters, blinds, and curtains open.  Check when you wake up.  Blue spectrum shifted light occurs around sunrise and sunset, and wakes you up, this is why you may feel a bit drowsy at noon.  This is still effective in blind individuals, but not in individuals that have lost their eyes.  Source:  I am a diagnosed insomniac, and have done a lot of research into this matter.

    "sft_question": "Question: Question on pecan pie from a non American Hello all!  My mother in law has been searching for pecan pies in the shops, but as we live in the UK it's not a thing here. I've found recipes I'm looking to try, however I want to make mini ones (individual in their own tinfoil cases) and was wondering if I still needed to blind bake the pastry and what kind of timing we are looking at since a full on pie is 30-40 minutes in the oven.   Many thanks in advance for your help!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "You'll need to blind bake even if you're using minis; otherwise the texture will suffer. The overall bake time will be shorter, but I can't give you an exact one, you just need to watch it until it reaches the right stage, which is described explicitly in Step 8 near the end of the recipe below. Even if you don't use this recipe, those \"doneness\" instructions are useful. Also, you'll get the best texture from your crust if you time your work so that the crust and the filling are both hot when you pour the filling into the crust, then immediately put them into the oven.  I'm offering you what is in my opinion the best pecan pie recipe ever written (not by me). It contains NO corn syrup, which can cause an icky, gloppy texture. Instead, it uses maple syrup, which remains velvety and soft and supplies an unbelievable flavor. The cooking time in this recipe is really different from most, because it uses a lower temperature (sorry about the Farenheit but it should be easy to convert). The lower temp also contributes to smooth texture and no \"eggy\" overtones. Just don't forget to lower the oven temp per the instructions after blind baking the crusts, because you wouldn't want to bake the filling at the higher temp.  I've seen people who hated pecan pie (because of the corn syrup) converted by this version of it. The flavor is incredible. If you can't get maple syrup over there, then yeah, the Chef John version is probably a good one because of the reduced amount of corn syrup. This recipe contains a pie crust recipe, but if you have your own crust recipe that you prefer, just go with that and roll it out, blind bake it and fill it hot as per the instructions here.   And happy holidays to you!  MAPLE PECAN PIE \r   Serves 8.   \r   If you want warm pie, cool the pie thoroughly, then cut and warm it in a 250-degree oven for about twenty minutes. More liquid than corn syrup, maple syrup yields a softer, more custardlike pie. \r   \r   INGREDIENTS\r   Pie Shell:\r   1 1/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus extra for dough and rolling surface\r   2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar \r   1/2 teaspoon table salt \r   8 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled, cut into 1/4 -inch pieces\r   2 tablespoons vegetable shortening, frozen, cut into small pieces\r   1 large egg white, chilled, thoroughly mixed with ice water (about 2 tablespoons) to equal 1/4 cup\r   1 large egg yolk, beaten with 1/8 teaspoon water\r   \r   INSTRUCTIONS\r   1. For Pie Crust: Mix flour, sugar, and salt in food processor fitted with steel blade. Scatter butter and shortening over dry ingredients and pulse until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, 10 to 15 seconds. Turn mixture into medium bowl.\r   2. Sprinkle egg white mixture over flour mixture and, with blade of rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix. Press down on dough with broad side of spatula until dough sticks together. Shape dough into ball with hands, then flatten into 4-inch disk. Dust dough lightly with flour, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and place in refrigerator for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.\r   3. Roll dough on lightly floured surface into 13-inch circle and transfer to 9-inch pie pan, preferably glass. Press dough into corners and sides of pan, being careful not to stretch dough. Trim edges of dough to make 1/2-inch overhang. Tuck over-hanging dough under so that folded edge is flush with rim of pan. Flute edge (illustration 1).\r   4. Chill shell until firm, about 1 hour. Prick sides and bottom with fork and line entire shell with heavy-duty aluminum foil, pressing foil firmly against shell and extending it over fluted rim, (illustration 2). Prick foil with fork (illustration 3) and return shell to refrigerator while oven is heating. \r   5. Adjust oven rack to center position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake, pressing once or twice with mitt-protected hands, if necessary, to flatten any puffing, until crust is firmly set, about 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until bottom begins to color, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, brush sides and bottom with egg yolk, and return to oven until yolk glazes over, about 1 minute longer. Remove from oven, and set aside while preparing the filling.\r   6. Lower oven temperature to 275 degrees. Place pie shell in oven if not still warm.\r   \r   Filling\r   4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces\r   1/2 cup granulated sugar \r   1/4 teaspoon table salt \r   3 large eggs \r   1 cup maple syrup, pure, preferably Grade B or Grade A dark amber\r   1 1/2 cups whole pecans (6 ounces), toasted and chopped into small pieces\r   \r   INSTRUCTIONS\r   7. For Pie: Melt butter in medium heatproof bowl set in skillet of water maintained at just below simmer. Remove bowl from skillet; mix in sugar and salt with wooden spoon until butter is absorbed. Beat in eggs, then maple syrup. Return bowl to hot water; stir until mixture is shiny and warm to the touch, about 130 degrees. Remove from heat; stir in pecans.\r   8. Pour mixture into warm shell; bake until center feels set yet soft, like gelatin, when gently pressed, 50 to 60 minutes. Transfer pie to rack; let cool completely, at least 4 hours. Serve pie at room temperature or warm, with lightly sweetened whipped cream or vanilla ice cream."

    "sft_question": "Question: I'm 23, self-learning Math/Physics - any advice? Hey everyone. I don't use Reddit a whole lot, but the more I get into self-learning, the more I'd love to have people to discuss topics with.  Quick background info: I'm 23, went to a private university for 4 years to get a degree in music education, ended up double majoring in Japanese studies, took too many classes outside both majors and couldn't graduate in time, so I decided to drop out.  I have a lot of interests, most of them in creative fields, so I'm grateful for what I got out of college, and I'm currently pursuing a career as a creative entrepreneur.  Creating and Learning are two primary things in my life that I never want to stop doing. I've always been a self-learner and recently i started spending more time pushing myself to read regularly.  This past month, I read Stephen Hawking's \"A Brief History of Time\" and it was super interesting. I've always had an interest in Physics, but only took one class in high school. I also took AP Calculus in high school, but it wasn't something I was particularly good at (I passed the class with a C+, but didn't pass the AP Exam). Either way, I'd love to have a deeper understanding in Physics and Math, so I'm starting a self-study project.  Obviously, I need to have the foundations down first, before I try to get into anything complicated.  I'm currently going through:  \\- A Stanford course on Coursera by Dr. Keith Delvin called \"Introduction to Mathematical Thinking.\" I just finished up Week 1.  \\- \"The Foundations of Mathematics\" by Ian Stewart and David Tall. I'm finishing up Chapter 2 on Number Systems.  \\- \"The Feynman Lectures on Physics.\" I read Chapter 1 earlier.  \\- I'll probably take the \"Single Variable Calculus\" course on MIT's website after I finish \"Intro to Mathematical Thinking.\"  I have a ton of interests, so I have no idea where this will take me or how deep I'll be able to go, but I'd love some kind of feedback/advice on self-studying Math/Physics - am I picking up good beginner material? Is there a way that I can use this subreddit to further my study? Anything like that would be great - Thanks!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Since alot of people said pretty much exactly what I wanted to, I'll add to their responses. A lot of people are stressing practice problems and I can't agree with them more. Sure you read the sentence \"Energy is always conserved\", and you convince yourself \"yea that makes sense, where else would it go if it wasn't\". Now you're inclined to go the next section, but WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE in reality for energy to be conserved? How is this a useful law? Only practice problems will show you the answers to these questions.   While pure math and physics are two separate disciplines, they often overlap especially in \"juicy\" parts of physics like quantum mechanics where it might as well be a study of pure math since you can't physically see any of the things happening in quantum. Take the time to really understand the math being presented to you. To start, I'd recommend differential/integral calculus, multvariable calculus, vector calculus, linear algebra, and differential equations. This should lay the mathematical foundations for you to explore classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, optics, special relativity, and intro quantum mechanics.   Finally, don't give up. Every single time you solve a problem wrong, you've just found another way NOT to do the problem. As silly as that sounds, I've found it to be incredibly useful throughout my studies in physics. You're going to drop negative signs, add numbers wrong, and completely miss the point of the question. Don't be discouraged. Even the best physicists to this kind of stuff. Hold out and keep studying and you'll get it. Good luck!"

    "sft_question": "Question: Neighbor is claiming they have an easement through my uncle's property. US/Ohio  Hello. I was hoping that someone may be able to advise me on easement laws in Ohio.  My great uncle has owned his property in Ohio for nearly 40 years. It was purchased from another family member.   Recently the family who owns the large wooded property behind my Uncle’s house have been approaching him saying that they have a 50 feet wide easement through his property. My uncle is very upset about this. These people have been very rude to both him and his wife. The part of his property they are claiming to be entitled to, has a large garden, well and other buildings on it.  I’ve not been able to find any detail about such an easement on the deed. It just says “the tract as surveys contains X acres, more or less, and is subject to all legal highways and easements of record.”  \\-Where can I find these “easements of record”?   \\-Also, 50 feet wide also seems oversized for an easement. I always thought easements were the width of a vehicle with a couple feet on each side???  \\-The family claiming to have an easement did not own that land when my uncle purchased his property. Their property is also not landlocked, as part of it runs along the road.  \\-The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.   \\-My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property. There is no easement described on the survey.  I’ve already advised my uncle to find a real estate attorney. He’s elderly and I’m trying to help him solve this problem. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. I do not practice in Ohio.  As a previous poster says the easement should be on record with the county recorder's office. However, It should have been conveyed to your uncle with a deed and likely should have been recorded if you have had a recent survey. Typically, in my jurisdiction, they research these things as part of creating the final documents. But this does not mean they can't make mistakes and miss these things. But they tend to be pretty reliable. This is what they do for a living after all.  So, new advice. First, I would not immediately believe a neighbor. While your deed says \"is subject to all legal highways and easements of record\", this does not mean there IS an easement. This is language to convey to the buyer that your are purchasing only what I, the Seller, have the rights to sell to you. It's a catch-all phrase so the Buyer knows there might be something you should have discovered when you bought this land that we didn't discuss at the time of sale.  Second, an easement does not grant universal access to something. Typically, they are crafted as small as is reasonable for the purposes. For example, if you share a common driveway, the easement would grant them access to regularly trespass over your land using the driveway. If you share a common utility hook up like a water main or sewage, it would grant them use and right to invade to repair it, but it wouldn't give them the right to regularly drive their car over the same property. So just because there is an easement, doesn't tell you what it gives them the right to do.  Third, an easement can expire. You can grant someone an easement for a term period. For example, you might grant someone an easement for a year so they can go over your property to build their house. Typically, you might see this in a subdivision where they might build houses in phases. In this case, typically the developer who owns all the lots and sells one and knows they will need to access it later while building on the adjacent property.  You might grant an easement for a period because they haven't complete their own egress from the property and you provide an easier access for a short period. So the language might terminate it naturally. In this case, if the language in the easement does not a have a termination date or set out a specific length, it is usually assumed to be perpetual.  Forth, an easement can be terminated by a change of conditions. For example, the easement says the person can run their water access until such time as they make repairs to the property. The point is that there could be a triggering event that ends the easement. Like above, it would only expire if there is specific language in the easement.   Fifth,I would not presume anything. I don't necessarily agree with one of the posters that this falls on your uncle to discover. While your uncle risks conflict and potential liability if there is an easement. Given there is a survey and a normal closing where it should have been discovered, he should feel comfortable excluding them from the property until they can show he is wrong. It would be in his best interest to call the county recorder and do a little research. But I do not feel he needs to go to extraordinary means to find out if something does not exist.  The thing about property is that almost all (really all but there might be some weird reason in your jurisdiction) of the time actions involving property have to be in writing and they have to be recorded for them to be valid. This is to avoid exactly this situation. People can make a promise a lot of times. They can write even a note or contract that grants someone access. But because any owner of land only owns it temporarily and the land exists forever, in order to bind someone to a forever agreement, that agreement should be fair for everyone to discover who might be bound by that agreement. Even if your great-grandfather wasn't born at the time of the agreement. So if it's not in writing at the recorders office, the easement doesn't exist.  Finally, there might be some minor really detail issues like adverse possession and prescriptive easement that might click in here. But really, these might be something you ask your attorney if this escalates and are very fact specific.  And that leads to my parting advice. If this escalates, have your uncle get a land use attorney for this issue. While most lawyers will know how to deal with the normal stuff, a land use lawyer really will know how to navigate it much more effective. These guys typically have specific local knowledge that makes them worth it.  I hope this helps and adds to the good advice of others here.  Good luck!"

It's done when the butter turns from yellow-ish to white and if you rub it between your fingers,  you don't feel a LOT of grains of sugar. (you'll feel some.) Just getting it all the way pale, if you're using caster is enough.  Eggs should be room temp. If your recipe called for cold, I don't know why. It's wrong. Also, don't beat the eggs first. Have a little bowl where you're working and crack the egg one at  a time  into that (just in case so you don't have to fish shells out of the batter if that happens) and then add it to the batter.  So with the butter and sugar creamed, add 1 egg at a time and let the mixer go for 20-30 seconds in between each egg on medium medium-low speed. you're not really trying to add any air at this point you just want to evenly get the eggs emulsified into the batter.  Using a rubber spatula, gently fold the SIFTED flour into the mixture. Be **patient** and gentle. Do. Not. Rush. This. This is a good time to get kids involved. They can hold the sieve and shake the flour into the batter for you while you fold.  I sometimes have cake-batter-hunting children around when I bake.  Line your tins with parchment with tabs that will make lifting the cake out easy and carefully fill the tin. Gently level the top of the batter. Use a spatula or something, don't bang the tin on the counter to settle it b/c that will literally settle-out the air. No need to be fussy about it though, just generally level is fine.   Check out this video with some good advice about technique."

We see Dr Strange go through 14 million possibilities. The only time out of those that Thanos actually loses was the original MCU timeline, and even in that he survives the snap. So it's safe to assume he survives in the other 14 million timelines as well. Nobody wins Russian roulette 14,000,005 times in a row.   Can it be thus concluded that Thanos intentionally excluded himself as being one of the potential victims of the Snap? So he actually broke his own principle of choosing victims completely at random?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Pretty sure it was confirmed that Thanos included himself in the Snap. He wouldn’t want to piss on everything he’d done and sacrificed just to try and avoid having to deal with the idea he might not make the cut.    Remember, the future Strange went with was the one he considered a best case scenario. It’s entirely possible many of them involved Thanos getting taken out on the random, but other factors kept it from having any meaning."

    "sft_answer": "Not many people have talked about this, but Master's and PhDs are pretty different and will lead to different outcomes. I did both - in that, I got a professional Masters, worked for a few years in that field, and now am doing a PhD in a connected field. I don't have a child but am married and a bit older in terms of the other students in the PhD.   I think a Master's (you can pick a 1 or 2 year program) with some sort of scholarship , may work for you. There ARE funded Master's programs. In my experience, they are geared to lead you to interesting jobs in your field of choice, as they typically have career councillors and stuff like that to help you. With a PhD, you are really going to be focusing on academic research, and it can take up to 7 years to finish, meanwhile there is a lot of stress about jobs. I wrote this elsewhere, but I am considering jobs that are less prestigious and well-paying than ones that I got out of my Master's. YMMV, but with a child and being career-focused, an interesting MA or MSc from a decent school will get you far."

    "sft_question": "Question: A bakery near me \"glazes\" their danishes in something that keeps them crispy. Any ideas what it might be? There's a bakery near me that makes shockingly good and interesting danishes. They really shine in terms of textural contrast. They must use a really high protein bread flour because I've not found such distinct lamination elsewhere, and it's on the chewy end. They typically put some kind of custard or cheesecake in the center, and some fruit or marshmallow on top. But the most intriguing feature of these danishes is that they have some kind of glaze, which I think contributes to the crispiness on its own, but also must help preserve the natural crispiness of the dough, because they stay crispy for hours.  I've tried to replicate this glaze at home many many times but one constraining factor is I genuinely don't know what it is. I don't \\*think\\* they are merely blowtorching sugar onto the pastry because it's not burnt. I tried painting some melted sugar on with a pastry brush but that was a mess -- the sugar hardened in the air on the way to the danish, so I doubt that's what they're doing.  I'd imagine something like a simple syrup would achieve the opposite effect. I doubt it's a jam glaze (it's shiny and sweet, but it's not fruity). I've also tried rolling the dough in sugar before forming the danish like a kouign amann, which was good but far from their effect.  &#x200B;  Are there other ideas I may be missing?

I'm working on a product for the marine industry that dives to a certain depth while being pulled behind a boat.  Naturally, the easiest way to tell depth is from pressure.

But that means the device needs to be equipped with batteries, be entirely waterproof, etc.   I'm wondering if there's another way to accomplish this. Perhaps a compressible membrane that gradually changes the angle of the hydrofoil as it dives... but this also seems complicated.  Would greatly appreciate input!\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: Explain like I'm five years old: The Trans-Pacific Partnership deal Please post all your questions and explanations in this thread.   Thanks!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Alright, let's kick this one off.  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a multi-layered deal whose particulars have just been agreed upon by the twelve participating countries. Its stated purpose is to reduce **tariffs** - taxes on bringing your goods into a country or sending them out - and therefore encourage industry by making it cheaper for importers and exporters to conduct business between these countries. Its other stated goal is to create a set of easy **rules** that businesses can live by when dealing between these countries.  The TPP is far more complex than that, however. Its subtextual function is to serve as a foundation from which to spread that set of easy rules to other Asian nations, with an eye to preventing China from setting standards among these countries first. The Obama administration is concerned that it's either \"us or them\" and that a Chinese-led trade agreement would set rules that American businesses would find problematic.  So what does it mean for you? Let's assume you are a citizen of one of the participating nations.  • A deal like the TPP involves identifying which tariffs affect **market access** and **competition** by creating a market that favors some producers over others instead of letting price, quality and consumer preference decide. For instance, it is very expensive to bring milk in to Canada, so even if you could sell your milk at a lower price, you will have to account for the cost of the tariffs, which will make your milk uncompetitive on the Canadian market. New Zealand and the US both want to see Canadian dairy tariffs lowered so that their milk producers can sell on the Canadian market more easily.  • When the market can decide and the barriers are down, we expect to see **open markets** offering **more products/services** than could previously have been made available. Prices should go down for certain products due to increased competition.  • A deal with as many players as the TPP rarely functions on one-to-one trades; instead, each party has a list of things that they want and needs to go shopping around to find ways to get their positions filled - a chain of deals wherein, for instance, Japan pressures Canada on the milk issue so that they can in turn see motion on their own priority, such as car parts. This is why the negotiations have taken so long.  • The TPP wants to **standardize** rules for trade among its participants, which cover a lot more than just tariffs and quotas. Other issues that have to be considered and negotiated include intellectual property rights and protections; rules regarding patents; environmental and labor regulations. In short, it tries to set standards on **how business is conducted**, both internationally and at home. It does this because uneven practices can result in uncompetitive market access.  • This standardization is hoped to **improve labor and environmental laws** across the board, as the need to conform forces countries that have been lagging behind in their standards to catch up with the rest of the group. By setting rules that apply equally to the US as to Malaysia, it is hoped that **people will be better off** and enjoy more protections in their working environment.  • To that end, the TPP will also have a process in place for what happens when someone breaks the rules - a **tribunal** which will decide based on terms laid out by the TPP instead of following the laws of any one government. This helps ensure that foreign companies are treated fairly and can conduct business under the same standards and with the same opportunities.   **Tl;dr the TPP is out to make business between these 12 countries more fair, predictable and even. It should provide more choice in goods and services and more bang for your buck, while making labor standards improve for people outside of North America who may be operating under less protections than a Canadian or American enjoys.**  --- What are some concerns? ---  • The TPP has been negotiated in **heavy secrecy**. While it's easy to see why keeping such a huge deal secret from the public is problematic, it is also reasonable for governments to work on negotiations and come to terms before letting elected officials decide if the end result is in the public interest. It lets others at the bargaining table know that what is said there won't be changed by a public opinion poll two days later, and it has been argued that such secrecy is therefore necessary to make these meetings work at all.  • The TPP has a **scope** that concerns many parties as it addresses trade and industry regulations on a 21st century scope - everything from upcoming cancer drugs to internet regulations to, yes, a cup of milk in Canada is all being covered by the same negotiation. It is a reasonable concern to say that the number of issues being covered in the same deal will make it hard for the public to reasonably read, understand and decide on.  • The removal of tariffs provides new foreign opportunities for business, but it also means that industries which rely on a **protected domestic market** will become exposed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that any given country is trading away the success of industry A for success in industry B, which, if all things are equal, should come down to a zero-sum game. Economics does not, of course, work like that, but it's still a fair question to examine.  • While supporters of the TPP say that it will encourage countries to improve their standards and reform, those elements are at their strongest during the negotiation - and the heat on issues such as human trafficking and human rights abuses have been sidelined as pressure to secure a deal of any kind has mounted on major nations facing upcoming elections. What should have been an opportunity to engage and demand reform as a condition of involvement in such a major global trade deal has been left by the wayside, a casualty of ambition.  --- What are the serious issues? ---  • While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, **large corporate interests** have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an **obligation** to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.  • \"Free trade\" as the TPP proposes is **nothing new** - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to **move jobs** and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.  • There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves **exceptions** in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those **standards lowered** - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business.   • Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - **jobs** - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.  • The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are **harsher than existing law**, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.  • More damagingly, the TPP **applies those laws to drugs** with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights **should** be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.  • The TPP will offer a method by which companies can **attack laws that affect them**, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.  • We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we're committed to an **all-or-nothing deal**.  **Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It's being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.**  Anyone with questions, comments, concerns, let me know here or via PM and I'll be happy to help."

    "sft_question": "Question: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...\"exits\", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Not a doctor. But I would just like to say, you discounted it being psychological because there are physical symptoms. However, psychological issues such as anxiety - particularly health anxiety - very commonly manifest all sorts of physical symptoms. Please don’t underestimate this, or what it can create within your body. Continue pursuing physical doctors by all means, but please also look at getting her CBT. It’s been instrumental for me in getting over my health anxiety and the physical symptoms that come with it."

Today they put up a sign on his property advertising it is an AirBNB rental for parties. Is there nothing i can do? Location: Ontario, Canada  Our neighbour who i will just call Guy, bought the townhouse next to us last winter, it is a 2 unit townhouse since we are on a corner. He immediately flat out told us he was renting it on AirBnB, and told us that if he caused problems for his guests he would \"come after us\".   The last year has been absolute hell for us, but apparently there isn't anything we can do about it. We have had to put up with his guests parties, guests parking and blocking us in our own drive way, guests pounding on our door at 4am because they locked themselves out, to people climbing and breaking our fence to get access to our pool.   In December one of his guests tried to break down our front door, and in a drunken rage and proceeded to throw beer bottles through several of our windows, when he couldnt get into the property. That was the breaking point for us and we basically gave up trying to live here.  We put up a for sale early this month, and immediately Guy was at our front door basically offering to buy our house for a fair bit below market value. When we refused he immediately told me i am a \"dumb cunt\" and i am \"lucky he doesn't sue me for harassing his guests\".   Today we were having our first open house, only to discover this morning a large sign in the bedroom window saying \"Proudly Hosting AirBNB, rent me via the App for your next party!\". The sign looks terrible, but the first question i got today from pretty much everyone was \"so your neighbour hosts on AirBnB?\", so it worked. Instead we got a single offer for a lot less than what most places around here go for according to our agent.  I am tired of this shit, and i am at wits end here. I loved this house, and both me and my wife wanted to start a family here. But now that Guy moved in with his rental company we can't live here anymore. Do i really have any sort of recourse here?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Oooh, a legitimate case of [block busting] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting)      I suggest you do the usual of getting cameras and a DVR and collecting a high light real of his tenant's behaviour over the next few months.  See if you can coax him into getting some sort of written offer to buy your home.      Then hire a lawyer to write a letter to AirBnb and provide your video evidence.  I'll bet he gets shut down.      Prior to that, it's also worth researching your municipal by-laws with regards to short term rentals.  Most municipalities have restrictions or a license requirement before you can rent out a property for less than, say, 30 days.        At the very least, make your local police station familiar with your neighbour's MO.  Especially in a smaller town it's usually possible to set up an informal meeting with an officer at the police station where you can explain the problem, show the collected footage and inform them about the situation.        They likely will tell you it's a civil matter, but it will give context to the noise complaints and calls you will continue to be making when your neighbour's guests break the noise by-law, trespass, vandalize, harass etc.        Officers have a lot of leeway when responding to these petty crimes and if they are familiar with a pattern of harassment from your neighbour they might be a bit tougher on him to smarten him up.  It can be the difference between an officer going through the motions of \"please try to keep the noise down\" vs \"Hey, stop fucking around, if I have to come back here someone is going to jail.\"         There is no simple solution but you can use a variety of tactics to put legal pressure on this jackass the same way he is illegally putting pressure on you.  He is trying to make living there as inconvenient as possible for you, and you have to fight back by making his illegal activities as inconvenient as possible for him."

The statistics of those getting into physics and ultimately doing research seem quite dismal from what I've heard. Is anyone here studying physics for other reasons and wouldn't mind sharing? I'd imagine going into industry is a common one. Or perhaps teaching?  Any snowflakes out there trying to create a youtube channel, or trying to become a \"gentle(wo)man scientist\" and do their own research self funded, or perhaps a software engineer that's trying to understand more and contribute on the side, or a medical researcher who wants to learn more about radiology for medical imaging?  It's a lot of fun for me personally and I'm genuinely curious enough to have math and physics fill my time. But as a 33 y/o dude, it's only been a hobby. I've been fortunate enough to become more financially independent through my software career but feeling like it's a bit unrealistic for me to get involved, esp. if it's getting a another bachelors in physics for $100k, then strive for a PhD for 5-7 years, then trying to get long term research positions. Seems like it would be a decade of sacrifice with very very low likelihoods of success throughout.   So what if there was another way to contribute meaningfully?

    "sft_answer": "I studied physics as an undergraduate and became an engineer. I had originally intended to continue on to postgraduate studies but in my work as a research assistant I realized that a career in academia — even in STEM — is a very unstable life, and even if by some chance one does find a themselves in secure position at a good institution, *as opposed to the more likely scenario of being an adjunct at a community college in the Southwest Kansas or the San Joaquin Valley making as much as an assistant manager at Target and being unable to advance because you have no means of doing research and thus publishing* you’ll find yourself constantly navigating complex university politics and having to scheme and maneuver for funding, and on top of that you have to teach. Working in industry or for a research institute or laboratory can be a lot better than academia but those are dream jobs, getting your doctorate with the intention of working at IAS or Fermilab or SRI or Bell Labs or the Max Planck Institute or Ames is like studying acting with the goal of going on to get the leading role in a Scorsese film. It’s what everyone wants, but getting a job like that is not just tough in the sense that if you’re intelligent enough and put in the work it’s feasible, you have to ge exceptional and the stars have to align just right.    On the basis of all that, I decided to go into electrical engineering. I design analogue integrated circuits. Is it exactly what I dreamed of as a little girl? No it is not, but that’s the case for most people’s jobs. The work is enjoyable and stable, I’m able to afford a decent life in a city that I like and pursue my other hobbies and interests.

I figure at least moss or mushrooms or whatever grows in that stuff would form making it better suited for life and less deserty, right?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "So many prople think we can just change an ecosystem to something else and that will be better. This is just like draining wetlands for agriculture or resource extraction. We used to think wetlands were just wasted land, but in fact they are very important to the function of the environment. We needed those.  Deserts are a type of habitat and serve an ecological function just as any other ecosystem does. They form where they need to be. Trying to cover them up or change them to something else could be disastrous."

    "sft_question": "Question: Change my view thatSevere gender dysphoria (the desire to surgically change one's sex) should be treated as mental condition, not a physical one. Severe gender dysphoria (if there is an exact word for the condition of wanting to surgically modify the sex organs, please enlighten me) should be treated as a mental condition.  Gender dysphoria is an internal conflict. It is not a conflict with societal values, or social pressures, like the triggers that led some to consider homosexuality a mental disorder. People who want to surgically change their sex would have this conflict in any society.   I think that these individuals would be happier if we worked to develop coping mechanisms and medication (like we do for other mental conditions) instead of treating them surgically.   Surgical solutions are imperfect, and an observant person can almost always tell the difference between a transexual and a person who was born with that sex. This hinders their romantic and social prospects, and often leads to that person being ostracized from normal society. Even as technology develops, transsexual people will necessarily require lifelong, expensive treatments with many side effects to keep \"passing\" as their new sex. I'm not sure how the actual sexual organs work for people who have undergone this, but I'm almost certain that they wouldn't work as well as the sexual organs that they were born with.   I see treating people with severe gender dysphoria with surgery as avoiding the mental condition (I don't mean this as a value judgement, only to say that their physical body is not at fault). People with other body dysphorias are generally persuaded to seek mental treatment instead of getting the surgeries they think they need. I don't see why it should be different for gender dysphoria. I have an anxiety condition(and I'm on the autism spectrum), and with mental treatment, I can function pretty well in society. No one would recommend that I do what I physically desire and never go outside or interact with other people.   If mental treatments are even moderately successful, they would result in a person who is at least somewhat comfortable in their body. I see this outcome as preferable to lifelong physical treatments to a body that barely resembles the preferred sex of the transgendered person. I'm not certain that the mental condition can be \"cured\" completely, but that isn't the criteria we use in the treatment of other mental disorders.      _____  > *Hello, users of CMV!

    "sft_answer": "> Severe gender dysphoria (if there is an exact word for the condition of wanting to surgically modify the sex organs, please enlighten me) should be treated as a mental condition.  Modern psychiatry, psychology, and medicine do not draw a clear bright line between \"mental\" and \"physical\" conditions.    Depression is the obvious example.  Some patients with depression require only therapy (i.e. \"mental treatment\") while others require drug treatment or even surgical intervention to resolve what is ultimately a physiological imbalance.   > If mental treatments are even moderately successful, they would result in a person who is at least somewhat comfortable in their body. I see this outcome as preferable to lifelong physical treatments to a body that barely resembles the preferred sex of the transgendered person.  The history of psychiatry (like medicine in general) is full of treatments that were the best we had at the time.  For instance, MAOIs are pretty nasty drugs compared to newer options, with a lot of side effects and potential complications from use.  But at the time they were first discovered, they were the best thing we had to treat depression.    Right now, we don't have any truly \"successful\" treatment for gender dysphoria.  Regardless of whether a patient undergoes medical transition or not, it's likely that they will be facing a lifetime of treatment in one form or the other.    What we have are a range of options that may provide some alleviation of symptoms.  It is up to researchers and medical professionals to investigate the risks and benefits of these options, and it is then up to patients to decide (with the help of their doctor(s)) which options are best for their individual case."

Here in this interview, Foucault says and he stresses on it —  > I don't say the things I say because they are what I think, I say them as a way to make sure they no longer are what I think.  What do you think he wanted to mean by this? I have some possible explanations —  - He wants to dissociate his personal self from his ideas. This would connect back his tendency towards keeping his private life away from the public, and also his theory of history of ideas where he claims that individuals who are _discovering_ ideas are not important when we compare them to the ideas themselves, and the episteme in the background. This is the most possible interpretation.  - He could be using his audience as a sounding board for his ideas, which are more like criticisms than concrete theories in themselves. That's why the things he says are not what he thinks, they're rather the things he does not think.  I'm interested in hearing what you all have to say about his statement.

    "sft_answer": "That question is similar to, \"how is a forensic team investigating a crime able to know what happened if they never saw it?\" They find evidence that was left behind that they can peice together to form a complete picture of what happened.   Paleontologists do the same thing but with extinct animals. They use fossile records which can't be understated in usefulness. Some fossils are actually completely preserved in such a way that you can take it apart layer by layer and \"disect\" an ancient animal. You can see the remnants of the food they ate, the size and shape of internal organs, etc etc and in doing so use logical reasoning to figure out how those adaptations would have been used.  Enviormental evidence helps too. A creature that builds a whole lot of nest in the same general area is most likely to be a group/pack/herd animal, for example. You also have the standard rules of evolution to help give you ideas as well. An animal that sticks out like a sore thumb or has an extreme adaptation is a clue that they specialize in some skill or trait because specializations are an evolutionary risk. (You *better* excel at it if you specialize or you've got nothing to fall back on.)  Now, are they wrong sometimes? Definitely. Sometimes a hypothesis can look probable until someone finds evidence that conflicts with the idea. We saw dinosaurs as more reptilian for a long time, until people started find fossils that included examples of those dinos having feathers and other features that put them more inline with modern birds. Its a game of trial and error. The more evidence you can find, the more clear the picture can become."

    "sft_question": "Question: Why weren't there any big civilizations in southern Africa? Hi, I was thinking a few days ago that I could name great civilizations from every continent, except maybe north america and southern africa. Southern Africa being mainly what in spanish is called \"black africa\", but I'm not sure how to translate it. The distinction being that in northern Africa, Egypt is an obvious example, but the ethnicity (is this the word?) is clearly different.   By great civilizations I mean people who lived in cities, their existence spanned at least a century and had some sort of architecture and big constructions like pyramids, machu pichu, the coliseum, etc. I know it's an arbitrary and probably useless definition, but it's what I think of when someone says \"civilization\".   This strikes me as odd because men came from Africa, specifically the souther part apparently, so one would expect African populations, being around the longest time, to have developed the greatest, most ancient civilizations. Just like you hear that some chinese dynasty existed 2000 years ago, why don't we hear of tales of African Kings that lived 3000 years ago?   It doesn't seem remarkable that native north americans didn't develop any sort of big civilizations because they simply weren't around as long as europeans or asians. You could argue that Incas were probably around pretty much the same time and managed it though.   I realize it's not just a matter of \"being around for enough time\", but since that's the only factor I can think of, I'm asking here. What other factor prevented the southern/black population of Africa, in spite of being the first ones around, to develop into a full fledeged \"ancient civilization\" like the chinese, japanese,  romans, greeks, incas, mayas, etc.?

For starters, risotto doesn’t take 45 minutes to cook. The recipe might take a home cook 45 minutes from start to finish. But in a restaurant, with already prepped ingredients, and much more powerful cooking equipment, you really only have about 15 minutes of boil time. Give or take.   Method 1: The most common method. Par-cooking. Cooking a large batch of risotto about 75% of the way, and then cooling it down. It is reheated in individual portions to order by cooking it quickly in a sauté pan and adding some liquid, like stock or cream.   Method 2: The large volume method. For large volume places that will go through a lot of risotto consistently, they’ll often just start a new batch two or three times a night. A big batch is made, and left hot to serve. When it gets low, and new batch is started with enough time to be ready.   Method 3: The authentic method. Smaller and higher end fine dining restaurants may make each individual order as it comes into the kitchen. Because everything is prepped before hand, it’s a 15-20 minute cooking time, and can easily fit within the constraints of a fine dining meal’s timing."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: LGBTQIA2S+ should be changed to SGM - sex and gender minorities Now before you get upset, let me be clear that I am NOT suggesting this change because it would make the term easier for straight people to say. Rather, I think that sexuality is a spectrum, and grouping people into one box or letter might make some feel like they don't fit. We say \"racial minorities\" both because it would be difficult to name each one in an acronym but also because some people fall into multiple categories - I feel we could do the same by using SGM. Let me also be clear that I don't think SGM should take the place of a specific sex/gender identity if an individual has one - if someone identifies as bi, we should call them bi. If someone identifies as asexual, we should call them asexual (and etc); but, if we are referring to a *community*, I think SGM makes more sense.\nAnswer: ",

It’s hard for me to see how a lesbian who fought for the rights of same-sex attracted people even has common political cause with a trans activist who believes attraction should be based on gender and sex is not a valid category.  The best lesson of the big acronym is diverse groups who seem like ideological enemies don’t fight each other much when they are under a common flag. We could probably get a lot done if we were able to create a super acronym and conservatives and everyone else together with us under a common banner… maybe we could create one that means liberty and justice for all…"

I understand that Skynet caused the initial nuclear weapon strikes that caused the whole world to go to war but how did Skynet continue to take over the world thereafter?

A is empty, B has a 24 pack of canned beer, already chilled to 40 degrees.     Situation 1:  The door is never opened.   My intuition is that they use the same amount of energy. Is that correct?  Situation 2: The door is opened once a day.  My intuition is that fridge B will use less energy.  When you open fridge A, warm air comes in that needs to be chilled.  In fridge B, less warm air enters because of the beer.  Beer has a high specific heat and so holds its chill while the fridge door is open.  Is that correct?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I commented situation 2 a couple days ago in a german subreddit. Here just thrown into a translator:  &#x200B;  The effect is minimal. Air has a heat capacity of 1.2 kJ/(K*m³). With a temperature difference of 15 K to the room air and a refrigerator volume of 200l, a maximum of 3.6 kJ would have to be postcooled. Regarding the thermal efficiency, I only found a Leifi page where a value of 2 is mentioned. You would need 1.8kJ electrical energy for the 3.6kJ. That is 0.5 Wh.  In comparison, a refrigerator consumes 200kWh/a (one from Ikea). That would be 550 Wh per day. So if you open the fridge 10 times a day, you could save 1% of the energy if the fridge was completely full. In reality, probably even less, because even a full refrigerator is certainly only half full and also not the complete air is exchanged."

We were supposed to FDA approval on a medical device in June that did not come through and they are being hush - hush regarding the deficiencies and plans moving forward. The company seems to be struggling financially and have been terminating long time (higher paid) employees without warning, or explanation. I have seen this coming so I secured a position with another company. I do travel for work and my schedule was booked through August so I was gracious enough to give six weeks notice as to not leave the company or my teammates in a bind. After 3 weeks, they gave me a termination notice citing that is their right to exercise in an \"at will\" employment state. I live in Az, company based out of Tennessee.) It is apparent they did this in order to not pay out my 60 hours of PTO I have stored in my account. The employee handbook says that if you do not give adequate notice or are terminated, that you do not get stored PTO.

    "sft_answer": "Some of the main points I've found:  * New atheist subculture is very insular and protects itself from self-correction or new information getting in. To take an example, I'll often present various versions of cosmological arguments in forums, and the utter ignorance about them is breathtaking. Even more breathtaking is the feeling that they generally *don't want* to learn about them, as they will instantly dive in trying to \"refute\" it before I'm even finished explaining, almost as if they've already decided the arguments don't work before even hearing them. In this way they are, IMO, very similar to religious fundamentalists.  * They have a strange definition of atheism as meaning \"lack of belief,\" which generally isn't used anywhere outside their insular subculture. The best response to this behavior is here. * As reallynicole pointed out, they tend be what I would call \"naive positivists.\" The view that science is the only way to know anything. Nicole pointed to her own comment on this topic, but another viewpoint is that positivism died out in the mid-20th Century. To use the terminology of new atheism, I might say that it was *\"utterly destroyed!!1!!!\"*, even though the reality is more nuanced than that. * Related to the above, they generally have a disdain for \"philosophy,\" which, as someone once pointed out, is like saying you hate thinking. They'll say things like \"philosophy didn't give you the laptop you are using right now!!!\" The silliness of this can be exposed by avoiding use of the word \"philosophy\" and instead using words like \"epistemology\" and \"ethics\" and \"logic.\" \"Logic didn't give you your laptop!!1!!!\"  * Also related to the above, they tend to be extremist empiricists. They'll sometimes insist that even math is empirically discovered by counting apples. Even the most extreme empiricists in history like Hume and Berkeley didn't go that far."

    "sft_question": "Question: If childbirth is one of the most painful experiences one can go through, how come it does not render the person unconscious as when having other forms of pain inflicted?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Most doctors and physiologists consider pain to be an activating stimulus rather than something that causes you to lose consciousness.  For example, when patients are undergoing an operation it is often necessary to increase the amount of anesthetic they are receiving once the surgeon begins to cut the patient.  Even though the patient was fully anesthetized before the cutting began, the pain of being cut activates their sympathetic and central nervous system and causes vital sign changes and occasionally limb movement. This OR observation is consistent with the fact that the intense pain of childbirth does not cause depressed consciousness, but actually the opposite. Thinking from an evolutionary point of view, increased sympathetic tone (i.e. increased awareness, heart rate, blood pressure, and pupillary dilatation) would be a very advantageous response to pain in many situations (such as when an animal is attempting to eat you). You can also verify this at home by providing painful stimulus to someone who is asleep and noting how their level of alertness changes afterwards.  The perception that pain causes people to go unconscious is probably based on two separate physiologic processes. The more severe of the two is called shock. Shock is a pathologic state where the cardiovascular system can no longer provide adequate perfusion to vital organs, particularly the brain. Shock has multiple causes but the one most pertinent to this question is hypovolemic shock secondary to trauma and blood loss. This occurs when there is simply not enough blood in the body. Once enough blood is lost, the brain becomes hypoxic, conciousness becomes depressed, and the patient will shortly thereafter die. Someone witnessing this process might incorrectly assume that the pain associated with this person's injuries is causing them to go unconscious. Another more benign explanation for the perception that pain causes unconsciousness is something called vasovagal syncope. This is stimulation of the vagus nerve, which activates the parasympathetic nervous system resulting in hypotension, bradycardia (slow heart rate), and possibly temporary hypoperfusion of the brain. The vagal nerve can be stimulated in many ways. Common causes are the sight of blood or other disturbing sights, extreme emotional duress, and straining during a bowel movement. It is common for someone who is hurt to look at their injury and have a resulting episode of vasovagal syncope, which to an observer might be attributed to pain.  http://www.dana.org/news/brainhealth/detail.aspx?id=10072 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001220/ http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vasovagal-syncope/DS00806"

In my experience, they are geared to lead you to interesting jobs in your field of choice, as they typically have career councillors and stuff like that to help you. With a PhD, you are really going to be focusing on academic research, and it can take up to 7 years to finish, meanwhile there is a lot of stress about jobs.

I recently moved into a new place that’s a gated community in California. There’s a fire lane sign posted on the side of my apartment and my neighbor has been parking there and even leaving it over night. Iv contacted my property manager several times about this issue and at first he would come out and have them move their car. Recently the project manager just says they’ll take care of it so they can’t park there anymore but my neighbor keeps parking there. Fed up with how it was being handled I told my manager if it happens again I’ll call the tow truck myself. They responded saying they would take care of it and make sure it doesn’t happens again. 4 days later and same thing happened so I called the tow truck. During the tow my neighbor came out and paid the driver to lower their car. They then ripped the fire lane sign off my wall which I believe is illegal?

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: The body positivity movement has long since forgotten about - possibly even never included - men. It goes without saying that the body positivity movement has been beneficial for women of all different shapes and sizes world wide; comprehensive, and intersectional discussions about things from stretch marks, to body hair, to  cellulite - and I’m all for these things. Women deserve to be confident in their skin, with their bodies, and free from superficial judgements levied against them by their peers or themselves.   Men, on the other hand, have been left in the dust. Look at the top 5 social media accounts that turn up when you search body positivity - they are not only run by women, but usually geared towards women, with some rare exceptions of particularly progressive accounts which may have some representation for Trans and non-binary folks.   Men’s bodies are still, in large, viewed in the dichotomy of attractive, or not, with less wiggle room on top traits men tend to be insecure about, whether they can help it (e.g usually physical fitness) or not (e.g previously listed issues for women, height, penis size, baldness, etc.)  Of course, I’m not suggesting some incel-mindset “these men don’t deserve love” or “beta versus alpha” propaganda, nor am I suggesting men necessarily require this kind of social support,  but the last bit discussion about men’s bodies had to do with the “dad-bod” craze of the mid-2010s, which still focused on large part on a specialized aspect of men, rather than a respect for their body the way the discourse surrounding body-positivity did for women.  I speculate these things don’t exist for men in part because of societal expectations on men as to be less concerned with their physical appearance (as not to be perceived as being girly/ supporting traditional gender roles) or show weakness regarding sense of self towards others (also gender roles.) However I also think their exclusion from the origin of body positivity may have inadvertently closed the door in the face of many men willing to open up regarding body identity.  With all that being said, I realize men, and women, and people in general cannot be generalized so simply. I know there are men unconcerned and comfortable in their own skin just as much as their are men willing to talk and require the help from communities online and in person, and I know there are many content creators who want to have men at the table to normalize discussions, but by in large, the “movement” of body positivity has long since left men behind.\nAnswer: ",

Plus as he also stated, there's no evidence of hoards of time traveling tourists (which undoubtedly, if time travel ever were possible, there absolutely would be).   I know the theories by Einstein and others that seem to prove it could be possible, but lots of things could theoretically occur, that doesn't mean there is any likelihood that they ever will. When it comes to time travel (at the very least traveling to the past), I think the proof is in the pudding. Thousands of years without a single substantiated case of anyone ever having done it seems proof enough to me.   I don't even mean someone would have invented it by now, I literally mean if anyone solved the space-time equation EVER there would be evidence of it at some point in the last couple thousand years. But there's not. So I really don't think it's ever going to happen.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: America is not land of the free unless you’re either already financially well off, or the small % of people who get rich. Growing up I always thought America was the coolest and wanted to live there (based on American music, TV, movies, etc.) however now I’m older my view has changed a lot and this is no longer the case.  My stance is purely comparing America to my home country (Scotland).  I now believe America is capitalism gone wild, which is great if you’re rich and successful already, but if you’re not it’s a rigged system you’re unlikely to beat.  In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.  Regardless where you’re born (I was born somewhere between lower and middle class), you have the ability to succeed as medical bills or saving for a child’s education won’t bankrupt you, whereas in America that isn’t the case.  Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it’s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.  I believe this is, in part, what lead to the opioid crisis America is currently in.  Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.  Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.  Obviously America is a world super power and leads the way in a lot of things, but I believe as a random person of average health, average intelligence, and average income, if you were plucked out the air and dropped in either America or Scotland you’d have a much better chance of “freedom” (in terms of actual freedoms such as freedom from debt, freedom from incarceration, freedom to get educated, freedom to be healthy, etc.) in Scotland (or other similar western first world nations) than America.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "For starters, our Healthcare system is NOT privatized.  We have a hybrid system, which is arguably the biggest problem.  If we had an actual true Capitalist, privatized Healthcare system, the US Government's spending on healthcare would be $0.00.  Instead, we actually spend *more* than every other nation on the planet on healthcare (per person).  Conflating that with education, those are not 'free', it's why people in Scotland (and Europe) generally pay significantly more in taxes than Americans do.  It's also worth noting that despite the 'free' education in much of Europe, the US actually has a much higher percentage of people with College degrees than the vast majority of Europe.  About 25% of the US has a Bachelor's degree, that's a higher percentage than Norway, Sweden, France, Belgium, Denmark, Spain, and Germany.  *Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.*  About 8% of US Prisoners are in private prisons.  Of all the things to point out, this one may be the most ironic, because about 15% of prisoners in Scotland are in private prisons.  So Scotland actually has a much bigger private prison issue than the US does.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_prison#United_Kingdom  *Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.*  Regardless of your stance on guns, I have significantly more ability to purchase firearms than you do.  Therefore, that means I have more freedom than you in this regard.  You can certainly argue over whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I'd say \"we need to restrict your freedom to make you more free\" is some Orwellian NewSpeak.  Edit:  Also, c'mon, do I really need to point out to you that Scotland arrested, convicted, and nearly jailed someone for teaching a Pug to do a Nazi salute?  https://www.newsweek.com/youtuber-count-dankula-avoids-jail-following-hate-crime-conviction-teaching-896831"

    "sft_answer": "It's not only English doing it. If you check how European countries call each other you would find a lot of even more interesting things. Examples from my own language - Polish - is Niemcy for Germany and Włochy for Italy. We also call Hungary Węgry - with both names somehow different from Magyarorszag as they call themselves.  Stores behind each of those are interesting and often different, but tend to boil down to \"people of X called people from Y name Z, as they have always done it because of some historic reason, and noone cared to change it\".  Then there are modern days name changes, where diplomats or tourism notices that name is problematic and starts a campaign. This recently happened in few countries, like Republic of Cabo Verde. The poor guys were called Cape Verde (Verde is green in Portuguese), which ended up being translated to specific languages, for example Wyspy Zielonego Przylądka in Polish. Which as you can imagine may be problematic, give that it's only one of hundreds of translations from around the world. Solution worked, and they are now Cabo Verde for everyone.  The other funny one is Eswatini, which used to have a name very similar to the one of small European alpine country starting with S.

I don't think that is true. Since the election, he seems to have struggled to get anything done even with about as favourable a situation a President could have.  He's argued for healthcare changes that takes insurance away from people despite promising to do the opposite. He's gotten the US more involved in Syria despite promising the opposite. He has claimed credit for keeping jobs in the US that were never going to leave and creating jobs that were already planned. He decided the low unemployment figures were real when he won the election. He claimed to \"drain the swamp\" then gave his family important jobs. He said Obama was wrong to use executive orders then did so. He still seems to be trusted by his supporters. Likewise, when he argued that Obama wiretapped him, I thought that Trump supporters would find a way to believe him. They did.  I think that Trump could do the exact same things as Obama and effectively do no actual work but as long as he offends the left and minorities, he will retain the support of >80% of his current supporters as the media they watch and their own bias will convince them that everything is getting better and Trump is doing a great job.

    "sft_answer": "Not an insignificant portion of Trump voters were also Obama voters.  This doesn't necessarily disprove your initial thesis that Trump supporters are basing their support for him off of something other than policy but I would argue that Trump and Obama were two very different people and represented two very different things. These voters clearly aren't supporting Trump just because he's a republican/conservative.   I would argue that Trump has been very inconsistent on just about everything except for two topics: Immigration and Economic Populism. A lot of rust belt/working class voters see these two issues as being their most important issues with gun rights being a close third.   To relate that to the previous statistic, Barack Obama won the rust part partially by using the same kind of rhetoric as Trump (although in his own unique way). He talked about China in the same way that Trump did, he talked a lot about keeping jobs in the country and attempting to keep them from moving overseas. Obama was also did a lot of deportation (although they didn't advertise that too much). Furthermore the Obama administration said almost nothing about guns until Sandy Hook which was well after re-election.   When we see these areas in which Obama and Trump overlapped with these voters I think we start to paint a picture of not \"personality\" based voters but rather issues based voters. It would seem things are single or double issue voters who could care less about the skeletons in your closet, your race, gender or whatever. I think they want to feel that somebody is speaking/fighting for them and that seems to mean tough talk on immigration and tough talk on free trade.  If Trump were unable to get anything done towards these objects or even reverse his position on any of them I argue you would see a significant slide in support from his core base of voters."

    "sft_answer": "Failure is weakness, and if your apprentices fail to kill you, then they were too weak to do so. The path of the Sith is a way to cultivate strength while paring away weakness like the scouring of rotted flesh. It is the duty of all Sith who value the Rule of Two to find the strongest apprentice they can, and impart all of their dark side knowledge to them.  Once you find and train an apprentice that is strong enough to kill you, then you will have done your duty as a Master and held true to the precept of strength, because it then means YOU were the weak one that needed culling.  When training your apprentices, you must always punish failure. You do not reward success. For them, there is only survival and the will to learn. The only true success they will know is when they take all of the skill and knowledge you taught them, and they use it to kill you. Only then, in your last moments, will you know that you have succeeded in ensuring the future of the Sith.  If your apprentices keep failing in their efforts to kill you, then YOU are the failure.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered. One thing I will say isn’t going to change my mind: anecdotes of “my school already teaches this” unless you can show me that it’s already happening in a large number of schools.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Ex-PhD student here.  You're missing something important: That scientific research is basically a pyramid scheme built upon academics fighting over a miniscule amount of money and lot of young students roped into performing slave labor. Scientists can be really creative with how they show only the relevant data to get something to be worth publishing. Research group leaders need to publish a lot, and often, just to keep their names relevant and their labs afloat. You're expecting younger students to read something that is most likely to be a piece of shit?  If a paper was worth reading, then a major publisher like Nature or Science would have written features about them intended for the general public.  Oh, and PhD students everywhere just read the abstract, look at the pretty pictures, go straight to the conclusion. If it's interesting, *maybe* they'll read the methods section."

In many ways it's a gentleman's game where you accept the adversaries choice without complaint or questioning the legality but move on and counter and escalate. Playing anti-life, the destruction of all, kind of removes all the pieces from the board. Countering with hope is essentially playing the only thing that can still exist when nothing else does and in spite of nothing else existing. So it is a counter and an escalation and a bit of a sucker punch. Countering with despair, depression or hopelessness doesn't escalate and one could argue that despair can't really exist without anything but rather it exists in spite of the existence of good things. Despair is corruption, misinterpretation and unwillingness. All these need something to latch on to and play off of.

    "sft_question": "Question: Explain like I'm five years old Why do so many pieces of East Asian media include the occasional word or phrase in English? I've noticed this in anime, video games, advertisements, songs... I don't get it.   If they're doing it to appeal to westerners, there's not nearly enough English, and if they're not, why bother?   Is it like how Americans will sometimes throw in a Spanish phrase for emphasis (i.e. claiming a dish is \"Muy Caliente\")?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "You hear it because your ears are sensitive to English words. But in fact all languages contain words from other languages.  If you said:  I picked up my kids from *kindergarten* where they had been making *origami* shapes, packed their *rucksacks* with *croissants* they hadn't eaten then dropped them off at their *karate* lessons (they are hoping to be *ninjas*!). I then had a *rendezvous* with a well-known *entrepreneur* at that *cafe* opposite the *delicatessen*. He told me his favourite music *genre* was *Ballet* and he loved *waltzes*. Then after, we went to a *karaoke* bar and ate *burgers*.  That contains 6 French words, 4 German words and 4 Japanese words. Anybody from those counties would have had their ears perk up when they heard them, just as yours did when you heard the English words in East Asian."

    "sft_answer": "This is just a silly issue of the inadequacy of descriptive language.  If the physicist describes the situation as \"two particles\" rather than \"excitations in the electron field\" he is employing useful but ultimately misleading language.  The best model for what electrons are is a quantum field which has the only slightly peculiar property that when you view excitations thereof they appear to be indistinguishable particles.  It isn't very mysterious when described correctly: it is a completely natural consequence of the nature of the field, to the extent that the model reflects that nature."

    "sft_question": "Question: I read that in the America's Cup (sailing) the boats could go up to twice as fast as the wind. How is this possible when the wind is their source of speed?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Because the sail itself can generate lift. What makes it even more interesting is that you do this while moving toward the direction of wind, not away from it ( at an angle up to 15 degrees to the wind, but usually around 45 degrees ).  http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/graphics/velocites.GIF  This drawing explains it quite nicely. The shape of the sail redirects the air from the wind which creates a force acted on the sail normal ( 90 degrees ) to the angle of the sail.  Also important to consider is apparent wind. Apparent wind is actual wind + wind you feel because you are moving. If you are moving with the wind, the faster you move, the less apparent wind you ( and the sails ) feel and when you reach windspeed ( if you could ) there is no force on the sails ( you move 10mph forward, wind blows 10mph from behind, you feel 0 wind ). But if you are moving toward the wind, the faster you get the more apparent wind you feel, giving you even more force on the sail, until the drag on the water and air is higher than the speed you are gaining which is then the max velocity you can travel at."

    "sft_question": "Question: Neighbor is claiming they have an easement through my uncle's property. US/Ohio  Hello. I was hoping that someone may be able to advise me on easement laws in Ohio.  My great uncle has owned his property in Ohio for nearly 40 years. It was purchased from another family member.   Recently the family who owns the large wooded property behind my Uncle’s house have been approaching him saying that they have a 50 feet wide easement through his property. My uncle is very upset about this. These people have been very rude to both him and his wife. The part of his property they are claiming to be entitled to, has a large garden, well and other buildings on it.  I’ve not been able to find any detail about such an easement on the deed. It just says “the tract as surveys contains X acres, more or less, and is subject to all legal highways and easements of record.”  \\-Where can I find these “easements of record”?   \\-Also, 50 feet wide also seems oversized for an easement. I always thought easements were the width of a vehicle with a couple feet on each side???  \\-The family claiming to have an easement did not own that land when my uncle purchased his property. Their property is also not landlocked, as part of it runs along the road.  \\-The family member my uncle purchased the property from has no recollection of an easement.   \\-My uncle had a survey done when he purchased the property. There is no easement described on the survey.  I’ve already advised my uncle to find a real estate attorney. He’s elderly and I’m trying to help him solve this problem. Any advice is greatly appreciated.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I am a lawyer. I am not your lawyer. I do not practice in Ohio.  As a previous poster says the easement should be on record with the county recorder's office. However, It should have been conveyed to your uncle with a deed and likely should have been recorded if you have had a recent survey. Typically, in my jurisdiction, they research these things as part of creating the final documents. But this does not mean they can't make mistakes and miss these things. But they tend to be pretty reliable. This is what they do for a living after all.  So, new advice. First, I would not immediately believe a neighbor. While your deed says \"is subject to all legal highways and easements of record\", this does not mean there IS an easement. This is language to convey to the buyer that your are purchasing only what I, the Seller, have the rights to sell to you. It's a catch-all phrase so the Buyer knows there might be something you should have discovered when you bought this land that we didn't discuss at the time of sale.  Second, an easement does not grant universal access to something. Typically, they are crafted as small as is reasonable for the purposes. For example, if you share a common driveway, the easement would grant them access to regularly trespass over your land using the driveway. If you share a common utility hook up like a water main or sewage, it would grant them use and right to invade to repair it, but it wouldn't give them the right to regularly drive their car over the same property. So just because there is an easement, doesn't tell you what it gives them the right to do.  Third, an easement can expire. You can grant someone an easement for a term period. For example, you might grant someone an easement for a year so they can go over your property to build their house. Typically, you might see this in a subdivision where they might build houses in phases. In this case, typically the developer who owns all the lots and sells one and knows they will need to access it later while building on the adjacent property.  You might grant an easement for a period because they haven't complete their own egress from the property and you provide an easier access for a short period. So the language might terminate it naturally. In this case, if the language in the easement does not a have a termination date or set out a specific length, it is usually assumed to be perpetual.  Forth, an easement can be terminated by a change of conditions. For example, the easement says the person can run their water access until such time as they make repairs to the property. The point is that there could be a triggering event that ends the easement. Like above, it would only expire if there is specific language in the easement.   Fifth,I would not presume anything. I don't necessarily agree with one of the posters that this falls on your uncle to discover. While your uncle risks conflict and potential liability if there is an easement. Given there is a survey and a normal closing where it should have been discovered, he should feel comfortable excluding them from the property until they can show he is wrong. It would be in his best interest to call the county recorder and do a little research. But I do not feel he needs to go to extraordinary means to find out if something does not exist.  The thing about property is that almost all (really all but there might be some weird reason in your jurisdiction) of the time actions involving property have to be in writing and they have to be recorded for them to be valid. This is to avoid exactly this situation. People can make a promise a lot of times. They can write even a note or contract that grants someone access. But because any owner of land only owns it temporarily and the land exists forever, in order to bind someone to a forever agreement, that agreement should be fair for everyone to discover who might be bound by that agreement. Even if your great-grandfather wasn't born at the time of the agreement. So if it's not in writing at the recorders office, the easement doesn't exist.  Finally, there might be some minor really detail issues like adverse possession and prescriptive easement that might click in here. But really, these might be something you ask your attorney if this escalates and are very fact specific.  And that leads to my parting advice. If this escalates, have your uncle get a land use attorney for this issue. While most lawyers will know how to deal with the normal stuff, a land use lawyer really will know how to navigate it much more effective. These guys typically have specific local knowledge that makes them worth it.  I hope this helps and adds to the good advice of others here.  Good luck!"

Different songs signified different mass movements. As we stopped fighting in ranks the role became largely a tradition reserved for ceremonial occasions.  In the US, military band members go through the same training as everyone else in their respective branch. Though often times the physical standards are relaxed and the strictness of the training personell isn't as rigid. Often times the band member will cross train on some other job.

    "sft_answer": "No. Assuming your use is actually covered by the issued claims (a question for a lawyer), you'd be infringing.  To show infringement in the US, the patent holder only needs to show that you're making/using their claimed invention (or it's \"equivalent\") without permission (license). Commercial sale is not part of the test. You making money is not part of the test. Financial damage to the patent holder is not part of the test. Your use without permission is per se damage to the patent holder.  What that damage is *worth* can depend on if you are causing traditional financial damage (loss of sales or whatever), but you're still infringing. The remedy would probably look like an injunction (a court order stopping you from using it) and the financial value of a license for the time you used the product.

On average, she has 1 drink (beer or glass of wine) with dinner with me, once a week. That’s it. She is definitely not addicted to alcohol or going through any withdrawal. No medication either. No family history of seizures or alcohol abuse, or any other medical condition.  She recently had 2 seizures, both times with me.  The first time, she drank 1 glass of wine on an empty stomach. Then after 10 minutes of finishing her drink, she suddenly froze and looked confused for about 2 minutes. She started to pee her pants and didn’t know what happened after she “came back”. We didn’t think it was a seizure because she wasn’t shaking or anything, but now I know that was a seizure because it happened again.  About 2 weeks after that incident, we were having a beer together with sushi. She had drunk about 1/6 a bottle of beer (literally like 3 sips). Then, she started actually shaking and making weird noises while her eyes rolled back— what you’d expect a seizure to look like. I tried to hold her up but she was shaking so violently that we both fell to the ground. It lasted about 45 seconds. She did not pee her pants, but she again didn’t know what happened after.   We went to the doctor but because of COVID-19, we need to wait a couple weeks to run tests. I am wondering if I can get any help or ideas on reddit. Please help, I am very scared.

I would jot that down when she was on her period and that she had a seizure. It could be hormonal related. It’s scary, my fiancé literally has to make sure I’m not stressed (a big trigger for me) because I had a bad seizure where a table fell on me and not to mention I had 9 seizures after drinking. It’ll always be scary. Just have to stay calm. If she has one again, just sit by her and rub her hair until she stops and make sure she rests after one. It’s energy consuming.

Please help, it's driving me crazy. 28 / F / caucasian / Maryland meds: sprintec, spironolactone conditions: none   height: 5' 1\" weight: 108lb activity level: fairly low but good diet and healthy weight  Really hoping someone can help me. There is a 'zone' of my mid-back that I can't bear to have pressure applied to. Massaging, poking, kneading, anything that would help relieve the pain and sensitivity triggers a full-body, tweaky reaction that makes me jerk away. Not exactly pain but it feels like extreme stimulation of all my nerves all at once. I highlighted the area on this stock photo. This has been the case since I was 14 or 15 years old. The area also gets stiff/tense/sore but I can't do anything to help it. I've only had one professional massage before but the guy asked me \"how long I've had sciatica\" (I wasn't aware I did), noted the extreme muscle spasms when trying to touch that area, and also noted that my glutes were spastic when manipulated too. Did some googling on sciatica and it looks like that ought to be lower in the back than this.  I know this isn't the most exciting or unusual complaint but really hoping someone can help. Right now it's really hurting me, feels like a tightly wound, tense area, and I can't seem to fix it with anything - heat or rest or meds aren't working and massaging it is out of the question.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: America is not land of the free unless you’re either already financially well off, or the small % of people who get rich. Growing up I always thought America was the coolest and wanted to live there (based on American music, TV, movies, etc.) however now I’m older my view has changed a lot and this is no longer the case.  My stance is purely comparing America to my home country (Scotland).  I now believe America is capitalism gone wild, which is great if you’re rich and successful already, but if you’re not it’s a rigged system you’re unlikely to beat.  In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.  Regardless where you’re born (I was born somewhere between lower and middle class), you have the ability to succeed as medical bills or saving for a child’s education won’t bankrupt you, whereas in America that isn’t the case.  Furthermore, in America not only is healthcare not free, but it’s so privatised doctors have ulterior motives in recommending treatment as they have deals to use certain medications, which means their recommendations cannot be viewed as unbiased.  I believe this is, in part, what lead to the opioid crisis America is currently in.  Similarly, your prisons are privatised which means they don’t have a vested interest in reforming you, but rather in keeping you behind bars to make as much profit as possible.  Regardless of my stance on guns I believe that the presumption that people could have guns makes your police more jittery leading to unnecessary shootings, which obviously are non existent here, and our police are generally viewed as civil servants, not soldiers.  Obviously America is a world super power and leads the way in a lot of things, but I believe as a random person of average health, average intelligence, and average income, if you were plucked out the air and dropped in either America or Scotland you’d have a much better chance of “freedom” (in terms of actual freedoms such as freedom from debt, freedom from incarceration, freedom to get educated, freedom to be healthy, etc.) in Scotland (or other similar western first world nations) than America.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": ">In Scotland I have free education and free healthcare - 2 things I believe are essential to a true land of the free.  why do you believe these are essentially to be a true \"land of the free\".  what land of the free has always meant is that you are free.

The king could take your land.  Your lord could deny your request to marry.  They could prevent you from moving.  Land of the free just means that you are free.  It doesn't mean that you are entitled to receive things from others.  Free healthcare really is the opposite of freedom.  It means that the state takes your money in order to pay for a healthcare system and you have no choice in the matter.  You don't control how that portion of your money is spent.  You don't have the freedom to provide for your own healthcare.  That's not a bad thing, america is the same with education.  I must pay my country taxes with fund my local schools.  I have no freedom there.  I cannot decide to opt out of funding public school.  Its not really a bad thing, but it is a limitation on my freedom.  Its not an extension of my freedom."

Hi there, im currently in high school and have some financial problems in the family, my parents are not satisfied with me doing physics (i mean get a degree and pursue higher studies in) as im also considering doing engineering as it has become a need. But i don't want to leave physics, i love atomic physics and cosmology so much.  I want to ask here, can i continue my passion for physics while I'm doing engineering (IT) , will there be time for my passion. Or else is there any scope to follow my passion and take out my family of this?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "So, I have a bachelor's and master's degree in physics, and for reasons that still elude me, I am now a civil engineer. I actually started out as a mechanical and electrical engineering double major before switching to physics because I liked studying the fundamental nature of the sciences a bit more than engineering, but I took a lot of engineering courses too since I wanted to do semiconductor physics.  You can totally do engineering as a physicist, or physics as an engineer. The two lines can get pretty blurry, especially as you go higher up in academia. It can be tough to land an engineering job as a physics major, but it's not impossible and given all the cutting edge technology coming out nowadays, having a solid physics background can be an advantage in emerging fields like quantum computing or nanoscale manufacturing. On the other hand, you constantly see engineering positions at the national laboratories, which gives an option to work alongside scientists without needing to get a doctorate. The two disciplines compliment each other really well.  As a high school student, it can be tough to say no to your parents since you're probably dependent on them for finances. There's a number of options available to you. Lots of folks have pointed out engineering physics, which is a good compromise between the two subjects. If your parents do insist on an engineering degree, know that you can easily go into a physics master's or doctorate out of an engineering bachelor's later down the line when you have some more independence. I've had many a friend go that route when they started in engineering but decided they really wanted to do more fundamental research in their life. You can also minor in physics, which will also help if you decide to pursue graduate school.  Another option that's a bit unorthodox but might help reassure your parents is to apply for a professional engineering license as a physics major. A PE license is the premiere credential in the engineering profession, and most engineers don't even have one (because it's not necessary for most private sector work), but the benefit is if you have it, you are legally entitled to use the title of professional engineer in ways others even with engineering degrees can't. You'll have to check with your state's licensing board requirements to see how it's done since the process is different in each state, but most have a pathway for non-engineering majors to obtain their license. You will need to take a few engineering courses to qualify (I think NCEES wants like 45 semester hours), so plan on at least minoring in some kind of engineering and taking some engineering courses as electives in your degree if you go this route. That's ultimately what I ended up doing completely out of necessity for my own job, but it's an option I encourage any non-engineering STEM bachelor to consider if they're having trouble competing for engineering jobs. As a tip, take the FE Other Disciplines test, since it's really a general physics/physical science test compared to the other FE specialized discipline tests.  Best of luck, and no matter what anyone else tells you, follow your passions and work towards the field you want. They don't have to live with the consequences of your own life choices and while they may mean the best for you, only you can decide what makes you happy."

Why can the number still be chosen? It seems fairly reasonable that the probability cannot be 0, as if you were to sum up all the probabilities, you have to get one as a result, while the sum 0 + 0 + 0 + ... + 0 + 0 (with an infinite amount of zeros) can never have any other value than 0.  But, the probability of choosing a specific number should be 1/(amount of natural numbers), which is 0, since the amount of natural numbers is infinite. Is it something about how the limit of 1/x for x -> infinity works, or am I missing something else entirely?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "As others have mentioned, you cannot assign a uniform probability distribution to the natural numbers, but I didn't see any explanations involving the probability axioms, so I'm giving another quick explanation in case it's more clear to some people.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms  The first axiom states that all probabilities must be non-negative real numbers.  Another axiom states that the probability of the entire sample space is equal to 1, i.e. that one of the events will actually happen. In our case, for example, we are assuming that a natural number will indeed be picked (as opposed to picking something outside the natural numbers, or picking no number at all).  The final axiom states that for any countable set of mutually exclusive events, the total probability of any one of those events happening is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities.  We can see that this prohibits a uniform (all the same value) probability distribution on the natural numbers. If the probability for picking each number is equal to 0, then the probability of our entire sample space is 0 - nothing can occur, contradicting our axiom that the probability of our entire sample space is equal to 1.   On the other hand, if the probability of picking each number has any positive value at all, then the sum of the individual probabilities for all numbers will be infinite. However, the probability of the union of all events can't be higher than 1, since the union of all the numbers is our entire sample space. Since the probability of the union of the events is 1, but the sum of the individual probabilities of the events is infinite, we are violating the third axiom I mentioned.  So to find a uniform distribution that satisfies the axioms, we'd need to find a non-negative real number that is not zero and not positive, which is not possible."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Minimum Wage Should be Tied to Housing Costs I believe we should start with determining a minimum number of work hours that would allow someone to be independent. I define \"independent\" as being able to afford single-occupancy housing on a single income.  Let's say my hypothetical society has agreed that working 50 hours per week should allow for independence. \"Independence\" is when that worker can afford a studio apartment within a 30 minute commute of their employer (where rent for the apartment equals no more than 28% of gross wages).  I think that we should work backwards from the cost of \"independent\" living, to determine the minimum wage based on the location of the job.  I believe using cost of housing is a more realistic and helpful adjustment factor than inflation. Inflation faces criticism from what it does and does not factor in. I think using actual housing costs tied to specific geographic areas would be most beneficial for the workers, because it reflects their housing reality. If a city's average rent goes up by $50 a year, the minimum wages should reflect that.  Currently, low-wage workers in sectors such as retail have to commute in to higher-cost cities. If minimum wage was tied to the housing costs in the vicinity of the employment, more workers could afford to live near where they work.  I am open to refining this idea, and welcome suggestions. I am sure I am overlooking some economic issues. The 50 hours per week was arbitrary. Personally, I feel like that number could be 32 - 40 hours per week. The commute length of 30 minutes is also arbitrary.\nAnswer: ",

Peter still has people he cares about for deeply and if anyone knew who he was, they'd be targetted by criminals in order to punish him. For example, the Green Goblin found out that Gwen Stacy was linked to him and he kidnapped her to lure Spidey into a trap, leading to her death.  There's also at least two storylines where the Kingpin found out Spider-Man's identity and harmed/killed someone he cared for. In canon, someone tipped off the Kingpin about his being Peter Parker and he hired a sniper who wounded Mary Jane - in an issue of *What If?*, the sniper killed her instead which resulted in Spider-Man going on a warpath to kill Fisk.  Fisk ended up turning himself into the authorities for protection under the stipulend that an Avenger protect him from Spider-Man. This resulted in Iron Man going to fight Spidey... only for Peter to reveal that he had a remote shutdown secretly installed into his suit (this was years before this was confirmed to be canon, BTW). Then Fisk hired some dirty cops to hold May hostage to make him surrender. Spidey punched straight through Fisk's chest, ripped his heart out and told the cops that since they're no longer getting paid, they might as well leave! Then he lets the honest cops take him into custody.  In another storyline (which was canon), after Spidey's identity was made public, Fisk sent some goons around to rough up Aunt May, in such a way that it couldn't be tied to him (Fisk was in jail at the time). Peter then proceeded to break *into* jail, beat Fisk black and blue and explained how he could kill him by drowning him in web fluid.

The Sith are an organisation so, sure, you could infiltrate them, pretending you are using the dark side or claiming you are trying to turn to the darkside or suchlike. It'd be hard but if you're good enough at bullshitting there's a chance. But embracing the darkside is a moral decision, and you can't just reverse a decision to change your worldview when it stops being convenient.  It's like infiltrating a terrorist cell by actually convincing yourself of their ideology and methods, and has the same obvious flaw. Once you've taken the step of actually using dark side powers, you haven't *infiltrated* the sith, you've *joined* them."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Trump could go back on almost all of his campaign promises and still retain the support of most of his supporters Before the election, many Trump supporters said that they supported him for his policies not his personality. I don't think that is true. Since the election, he seems to have struggled to get anything done even with about as favourable a situation a President could have.  He's argued for healthcare changes that takes insurance away from people despite promising to do the opposite. He's gotten the US more involved in Syria despite promising the opposite. He has claimed credit for keeping jobs in the US that were never going to leave and creating jobs that were already planned. He decided the low unemployment figures were real when he won the election. He claimed to \"drain the swamp\" then gave his family important jobs. He said Obama was wrong to use executive orders then did so. He still seems to be trusted by his supporters. Likewise, when he argued that Obama wiretapped him, I thought that Trump supporters would find a way to believe him. They did.  I think that Trump could do the exact same things as Obama and effectively do no actual work but as long as he offends the left and minorities, he will retain the support of >80% of his current supporters as the media they watch and their own bias will convince them that everything is getting better and Trump is doing a great job.  What would CMV is proof that Trump's support is down to his policies and not his behaviour and that his support is capable of changing their minds and will not follow him blindly.  _____  > *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

    "sft_answer": "I would argue that your premise does not have a strong base. While 80% is still a supermajority, losing 20% of his supporters would mean landslide victories in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, etc. where Trump only won by a small margin.

I've worked other career fields and in my personal opinion,  engineering kind of sucks.  I enjoyed schooling. But I don't necessarily want to become a professor or go back.   I would wager most of us are somewhat overthinkers. And my brain just doesn't turn off. This was probably a good thing 500 years ago.

    "sft_question": "Question: My boss canceled our holiday break because I asked when a good time would be to take my vacation days, feeling down about my chances of having a career in our (small, incestuous) field I'm a metallurgical engineer at a forensic engineering firm in Canada. I've been in the doghouse since July since my boss, the business owner, found out that I was working 8+ hours/day but not always taking my full (unpaid) lunch hour and leaving early. My coworkers all work varying hours and it was stressed to me that flexibility was normal and expected, but what I was doing was apparently a huge trespass on my boss's generosity and taking advantage of him. I am paid a salary.  This month I asked when a good time would be to take my remaining vacation days and didn't hear back, and we got busy anyway. As the month drew down and it looked like we were going to close over christmas/new years anyway, I asked if I should request for my vacation days to be held over since there wouldn't be an opportunity to take them. My boss called me into a meeting this week with the other engineers where he announced that he'd changed company policy to forbid holding over vacation days and had cancelled the holiday break, so anyone with remaining vacation days could use them next week. The technicians don't get vacation days and are required to come in.  He told everyone about my nefarious scheme to get extra holidays by holding over my vacation time to next year, and that was taking advantage of him and was damaging to the business, because who would cover in terms of cash and manpower if he was forced to allow employees to take vacation time that had... already been allocated...  The good news is that I got a recording (Canada is one-party consent) that's now on multiple cloud services of him describing how he didn't plan on following our province's employment laws regarding vacation time, and stating that canceling winter break was to retaliate against me for requesting the vacation time offered to me in my employee contract, but in the end I'm feeling really down about this.  Trying to work here has been a drain on my sanity and health, and I've been looking for other employment basically since about 6 months in, but the recruiter calls dried up with COVID. I'm thinking of an interview I had with another forensic engineering firm where they said that their engineers had to handle 20+ active investigations, and that they knew my boss, and I just feel defeated.   I've got a massive industrial investigation going right now and a handful of insurance ones, and the workload is so heavy. I do my own labwork and my boss yells at me if I pass too much to the technicians. I read more papers every few months than I did for my whole masters. We've skirted COVID restrictions so I've still been in the office every day. I have no short term memory and took on 3 prescriptions to try to control all my stress-related illnesses.  How can I manage 20 files and take on full responsibility for the conclusions instead of filtering it through my boss? He shows me all the bad forensic reports that he tears to shreds and tells me about other young engineers who were run out of the industry, and how bad it is at other firms. Yeah, he's doing that to control me, but maybe that is how it is.  Everybody seems to know everybody in this field, and my boss will just tell all his contacts how I screwed him over unfairly. I want to solve these forensic mysteries and help clients, but that might mean letting my boss do what he wants, because I need the experience and references. I'm going to go for a consultation with an employment lawyer, but I'm discouraged because the legal remedy may be at best a small financial payout + getting blacklisted in the industry.  I also keep trying to compose something to send my boss to try to keep the peace until he finally fires me, but it keeps turning into \"hey taintmonger, vacation time per year is guaranteed by law and not something you get to bestow on or snatch away from your employees\".  This a \"woe is me\" post but I'm looking for some perspective from other engineers, which might be \"STFU at least you have a job right now\". I applied to about 170 to get this one, which is my second job out of grad school. I have a masters and a 3.9 GPA, but I feel like that meme image of Boromir shot with three arrows.

    "sft_question": "Question: How can I course correct my career? I graduated with an Ocean Engineering degree in 2014.  I worked for 2 years at a small engineering company before being laid off about 4 months ago. I think it was a mix of things that lead to me being laid off. I have not been able to really find any jobs in my field in Houston since that time.  There don't seem to be any job postings for positions relevant to my experience and I am afraid I will be running out of money in the next 6 months.    As far as my experience with my previous job, I felt fairly anxious from the beginning.  From the interview, the company said they were fairly intense and had high expectations and that I would be working mainly in the marine department, but also picking up slack in the structural department.  For the first 9 months things went fairly well, but then it started falling apart.  They ran out of work in the marine department from that point on and I never really did anymore meaningful work like that again which was what I went to school for and was  a major disappointment for me.  They transitioned me to the structural department and I started getting up to speed there on a few small projects.  I enjoyed the freedom to create solutions myself, but I struggled with several aspects of the job, mainly that I was slow to produce results (mainly fab and test drawings, and load reports).  Then, I got some very tedious, time consuming, and low low low priority jobs.  I honestly think they were just biding time hoping more work would come, but it never did. I tried in earnest at first to complete them, but then they just gave me more of the same.   From here, I got very depressed/frustrated with my work.  It felt meaningless, I could never get priority on drafting rescources, and my managers would check in on me about twice a week for a few minutes top because these jobs were so low priority. I tried to bring up my concerns, but it was a fight to get anyones attention for more than 5 minutes, and I was afraid to say I was wasting my time and being unproductive.  I would get stuck often but no one would take me seriously if I asked for help, the projects were conceptually simple but logistical nightmares, so their answers were dismissive in my opinion, they would just spitball some ideas that fix one problem but created 3 more and just seemed annoyed that I was wasting more of their time.  I won't lie, it got to me and I started dreading working on these projects. I started wasting time.  I was on my phone, or browsing the web a bit, but mostly it felt like I was just staring into space hoping that something would come along and help me get through these projects. I fell behind on deadlines, made a lot of mistakes on the work that was being completed that had to be reworked or fixed later, and it all culminated in a colossal mistake that embarrassed the company although it didn't cause damage or cost too much relatively.    If i'm honest, I feel like they massively mismanaged my hiring and training process, and also that I didn't put in 100%.  All of my coworkers had masters in structural and more experience.  I would never have been hired into the role without the managers tossing me around.  There was one coworker who was exactly the same qualifications as me but a few years older, he got all of whatever work went into the marine department, and I ran support on the very limited occasions he needed it.  I could never convince anyone to make this split more fair on continue my training in that discipline to get me to the level where I could take any more of it on, I just got stuck with more structural work.  I did like many parts of my job, and I did not feel any of it was beneath me, I just felt that I wasn't suited for the structural work and that I wasn't particularly good with it.  I am at a loss as for what to do next.  I can't find a job, or even get interviews and I feel like its because my experience is this awkward hodgepodge of random things.  The oil and gas industry has been in a slump, so there arent many jobs out there anyway.  I feel like I have been working too long and that I am being passed over for entry level positions when I would be more than happy and willing to try a soft reset on my career.  I have a lot of doubt about whether my company was just a bad experience for me, because I had 1 coworker in particular who seemed to flourish in that environment and got all the marine work for himself, while I floundered.  Is it me? Was it legitimately a lack of work and just poor timing like they said in my exit interview? Am I cut out for this career, or should I try and find something else before I run out of money/time?  Is this experience normal? My biggest fear is that I get another job and that this is just standard practice, and I am not cut out for all of this.    I guess I am just looking for reassurance, advice, other perspectives. Anything really.  I learned a lot from all this and I have been forced to really look inwards and evaluate what I need to fix, and I am willing to do it.  My family and friends have been a huge support, but getting fired really has brought up a lot of self-doubt about whether I can be a successful engineer.  I just remember being anxious from the beginning and having some success, but then it just started going wrong, and the anxiety buit and built and it became self destructive, and then I got fired, and now I just don't know how to put myself right.

    "sft_answer": "I think you'll be surprised at how much you know when you start your next job. The first job out of college always feels stupid and stirs up shitty feelings. Don't sweat it. Everyone has a internal level of insecurity that gets multiplied with unemployment/job-searching. It can be rough out there. Especially in the oil field. Start looking into civil companies. CH2M, Amec, and AECOM to name a few.  I suggest getting a part time in the interim to get your mind off things and really dig into self marketing. That or find some certification to study for. You have a wide range of experience to pitch to people, so dig deep. Some one capable of wearing a lot of different hats is valuable in any field. Also you care a lot about being technically proficient which puts you ahead.  The longer you work in any field, the more you will find people with no technical ability in high places just by self marketing. I'm not trying to be a downer but I guarantee you'll find someone in your office one day that you'll look at and think, 'if HE can make it, well I'm gonna be just fine.'  EDIT: Also get that fun part time working with a bunch of other young folks that you always kinda wished you did when you were working the 8 to 5 with the baby boomers. If I was layed off, first I'd hike the Pacific Northwest Trail, second I'd try and get a part time job at a climbing gym, or mountaineering shop, or maybe even Trader Joes. Or I'd maybe deliver mail and listen to audiobooks all day while walking around. Then I'd study for the Fundamentals of Geology exam and get that cert. All the while I'd apply to real jobs in exciting new citys.   Not that I ever want to get layed off but I'm someone that likes having plan A, B, and C set up for my mental health.  EDIT2: Also find an engineering society you actually enjoy. When I lived in NC I tried going to ASCE meetings and they were okay. Then I went to the local Engineers Without Borders Chapter meetings which consisted of 6 or 7 really cool guys that met at the brewery every month and things really clicked. I got some great letters of recommendation off those guys and loved working with them. Also we helped out some people in the meantime."

    "sft_answer": "There is always a lot of misinformation on this topic. I think /u/BigBrainMonkey said it best in this thread. I recently attained a job in industry after graduating with a PhD in ME with a focus on mechanics of materials. So, my experience is related to the types of positions for that field.  First of all, let's focus on why you want to get the PhD. You *do not* get a PhD because you think it's going to open up a world of possibilities in that everyone will want to hire you. You get a PhD because you love working on very difficult specific problems which have very likely not even been attempted before. You also like to get to a fundamental understanding behind these problems. You can see how this description aligns perfectly with research. It also opens up a world outside of research pertaining to the most difficult technical challenges an industry or company might encounter.  So, where you work after finishing the PhD? There are 3 primary areas as I see it: (1) academia, (2) national labs, and (3) industry.  * Academia - teaching and research. Currently, it is very difficult to get a tenure-track academic position. The upside of academia is you define your own work and collaborate with some of the best minds in a subject area. The downside is become a glorified program manager immediately - you don't do most of the work, your students do. You are also constantly fighting for funding. Also, normally before you can get a tenure track position you need to complete a 2-3 year stint as a post-doc. * National Lab - research and project work. The work at national labs is fairly varied but you still get to do research-type work. Most national labs require you to enter as a post-doc and then offer you a full-time position as a staff scientist after 1-2 years depending on appointment and the specific lab. The downside is many of these jobs require a security clearance so it's limited to US citizens. The culture at different labs varies greatly and no one is the same as another, e.g., LLNL is very different from ORNL. * Industry - almost all project work. One professor I know has said the age of true industrial research is gone, which in reality is not a bad thing. There are many good and bad things that people have hinted at in this thread. To be honest, this is the area I am least familiar with at this point, but I'll go through some points that I have been brought up by others and what I can say from my experience and the experience of the many PhDs I know who went to work in industry. It's important to note when looking at positions in industry you should take not of some advice I was given by an acquaintance at the NRC. In more or less words: \"I don't hire PhDs for what they currently know and what their academic research topic was. I hire them because the PhD is effectively a license to solve very difficult, ill-defined problems which have no prior answer and push the bounds of current engineering knowledge.\"   I'll try and go through some things about industry:  * \"You are too qualified for most positions and your opportunities are limited\" - This is absolutely 100% true. You are too qualified for most positions and because of that you have limited your opportunities. But, let's assume you got your PhD for the right reasons - research/advanced development oriented work. So, do you really want those jobs? Do you really want to do the normal BS qualified test engineer position? It's not a knock on those positions at all, you just have to make sure you get the PhD knowing full well that you want to do \"research-type\" work. So, even if you were able to get those jobs on an equal playing field, you wouldn't want to do them anyways. * \"In my experience, mostly heavy industries, outside of advanced development and research there very few PhDs around\" - This is again absolutely true. Why would a company want to pay the premium that a PhD demands when they can have someone with a BS or MS do the same work just as effectively. The PhD holds its weight in positions which are normally highly analytical or computational heavy. Projects or areas that would require more specific training and in-depth knowledge. This is what your PhD gives you, the knowledge to solve these very difficult problems. The PhD also says that you can effectively self-teach yourself very difficult new topics. This is what you did during your dissertation research, is it not? You taught yourself to the edge of knowledge of a very specific topic. This has shown you can do this and could do it again. * \"Be commissioned and trusted to develop entirely new methods, or technologies\" - Again, this absolutely true. As I just said above, you know how to push the edge of the unknown. * \"Many employers will be afraid to hire you for fear of you leaving when you realize you are making the same as your BS/MS counterparts\" - If you encounter this, then you're looking in the wrong places. The places that know they need PhDs will know what they're looking for and won't be afraid to hire a PhD. You'll also be paid appropriate for the PhD. There are websites which list the starting salaries of PhDs in different fields, etc. I know the average starting salary of an ME PhD is right around $90k, with that going up or down based on industry and location. The average starting post-doc at a national lab is around $72k, I believe. Is it going to be harder to find a job? Significantly harder but that's because there's significantly less of them available which are appropriate for you. * \"NASA and JPL have position that require at least a masters. Some even require a phd.\" - These are effectively the positions you're looking at when you're looking for jobs. Look around at the jobs postings at most large companies including JPL, SpaceX, Boeing, Lockheed, GM, GE, etc. You'll see a decent number of positions that are MS required, PhD preferred (note, they even have a decent number of 0 year experience entry level positions with these requirements). A majority of these positions will be computationally focused - think FEA and CFD. Look around at these to get a sense of the jobs that are available to PhDs. * \"You go for industries which look for a specific qualification and there are some of them in which is easier to go up in the 'ranking' thanks to a Ph.D.\" - This is the last point I wanted to make. By having a PhD, you no longer have a ceiling on the technical track at most companies. You'll notice the more senior technical positions will start requiring MS and PhD. Also, these positions are significantly more saturated with PhDs than at the less senior levels.  I hope this helps some. I know it's a wall of text, but I just wanted to give some context from the PhD side of things since we are likely going to underrepresented in a sub like this. If there's any PhDs with more experience in industry, feel free to come by and kick the shit out of my answers. This is just my opinion from my own experience and experience of others I know.  As a note, from personal experience, the job I recently attained is not in a company's research lab. I accepted a position doing high strain rate computational mechanics focusing on fracture phenomena for a large company. The position is in the advanced development arm of the company. FWIW, during the hiring process, the manager told me that they are now hiring a minimum MS with a strong preference for PhDs. Apparently, BS level hires, even with some experience, were not working out doing this work for one reason or another. That's just my experience and I'm entirely sure if it's typical or atypical."

I’ll add vinegar or lemon juice to make up for the acidic flavor wine would add if it needs it, but overall most recipes don’t actually need wine.   I’ve used alcohol twice in recipes since I got sober. One was bourbon. My fiancé keeps bourbon in the house but it’s hidden. I told him the amount I needed and gave him a measuring cup, I actually put a mask on because I was afraid of the strong scent of it when it would hit the pan triggering me 😂. He poured it in and took over while it reduced.   Second time I needed 2 cups of white wine for a sauce. Fiancé bought it, kept it hidden till I needed it, poured the amount I needed right before I had to add it, and dumped the rest. He then added it and took over for a bit while the scent died down.   This method isn’t doable if you live alone unless you’re super comfortable in your sobriety, but just thought id add my experience. I never considered cooking wine because of what I’ve heard about it, but maybe I’ll give it a shot in recipes that only call for a small amount since a lot of people here think it’s fine.

    "sft_question": "Question: Advice on improving Academic Writing! I'm trying to form a habit to practice academic writing regularly. My experience so far has taught me that I need to focus on following things:  1. Grammar 2. Critical Thinking:to form sound arguments and synthesize material  3. Overcoming procrastination: because I'm absolutely terrified of writing.    I'm brushing up grammar and studying about critical thinking through MOOC courses. (I can link it up in the comments, if anyone is interested). However I've come to realization that I need to practice alongside learning all this. If not, this goal will easily take a backseat for me.   Presently I'm trying to follow Patricia Goodson's Becoming an Academic Writer. (I also intend on going though books by Paul Silivia and Helen Sword)   What I need help with:   1. I'm confused about what to tackle during these exercises (for example, setting aside time daily for writing). Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind?   2. What other aspects of writing and practice  should I focus on?    (About me: I'm a psychology undergraduate, looking forward to start MSc in Clinical Psychology. English is not my first language)\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Create a writing group.    One of the things I have found that helps me get over my procrastination is accountability.  So, at various stages in my academic career (grad school and early faculty), I found a group of people in a similar situation and we'd pick a 2-hour block that worked for all of us and we'd meet in a conference room or coffee shop and focus on writing, this creates the accountability.  Some groups have been more formal about allocating specific times for asking questions and setting goals for the day and others were literally show up and put headphones in.  But the key to both was showing up and writing."

I know that you can write code to let the computer know what to do when and where. but how does it know the language? where does it come from? is it a kind of a databse?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The first programming language was assembly language. This assigned words (e.g add, jump) to the \"machine code\" - binary numbers that the CPU read. These were converted by hand.   It didn't take long for someone to get the computer itself to do all the hard work so we had assemblers.   But people also realised if you have a computer doing this you can translate more complex ideas to machine code so the earliest programming languages were written. The tools that turn this into machine code are called compilers.  These were used to write more complex languages.   So if you were able to find the source of every program ever, you'll find any programming language is written using a series of compilers and assemblers going back to some guy working out how an assembler works on paper and converting instructions by hand."

Many textbooks will even have built-in assignments and projects that you could adapt to your purposes.  This suggestion is not based on my knowledge of sociology so much as on the survival skills I picked up while teaching.

    "sft_question": "Question: If the EU is so focused on Euro emissions standards, why is there not more focus on truck design? So this is gonna sound like a bit of guesswork, and it is.  However as a truck driver, I full on believe that I can *feel* the extra resistance when driving a Cabover truck versus a bonneted truck.  Plus from my experience, our Bonnet trucks got better economy over our new Cabovers at work.  The old bonnet trucks did around 650km from 400l of Diesel, these were running Mack Engines designed in the 70's, so an economy of 61.54l/100km at 55 tonnes  The new trucks are a tad heavier, I've not had one past 60 tonnes, however we get down to 350km from 400l of Diesel, which comes to 114.29l/100km on some runs.  The new heavy transporter (low loader) can get, on a good day, 200l/100km and if terrain is bad, even less, but that's in excess of 100 tonnes.  However then you go across to companies that make bonnet trucks, so for example the drag co-efficient of a Tesla Semi is 0.35, most Bonnet trucks get around 0.5 and most Cabovers get as high as 0.9  So it makes me think if anyone knows how to reduce aerodynamic drag, it would be Tesla, so they clearly picked a bonnet truck for a reason.  Now, to me, even with the DPF and DEF and all the other emissions gear, the fact that our new trucks that are Euro 5 are chewing damn near double the fuel of our old trucks at a similar weight makes me wonder, is this Euro 5 Emissions stuff actually achieving anything?  Would Manufacturers possibly see better gains from making more aerodynamic bonnet trucks? I get that you might have to knock maybe 2-4 pallet spaces off a trailer to get the overall length to be the same, to remain under dimension limits, however if you're spending half the money on fuel, surely those savings could stack up over 1,000,000kms?  For reference, our Cabovers will chew 1,142,900 litres of fuel, the old truck would chew 615,400 litres, so a saving of 527,500 litres over the life of the truck, or at current Australian prices of $1.19/l that's around $627,725 AUD per truck, so a fleet of trucks us a massive fuel saving  So looking at a cost of $2.05/km on average to operate a truck in Australia, and an average 45ft trailer so for 26 pallets that's around $0.07884615/pallet/km  So freight of 1,500km as an average would be $118.27/pallet per trip  So if your average trip is 1,500km then you would get 666 trips out of your truck per million kilometres.  So that's $78,767.82 earned by that truck per pallet space, so removing 2 pallet spaces would lose $157,535.64 over the lifetime of the truck, 4 spaces would lose $315,071.28 so even losing 4 whole pallet spaces to run a bonnet truck to a Cabover would still net you a saving over the life of the truck of around $312,654 if the fuel savings I've observed hold true.  So yeah, it's got me wondering why Euro Emissions aren't calling for more efficient truck shapes, and instead seem to focus on engines and exhaust emissions?  Is there a practical reason why Cabovers are still preferred by European truck Manufacturers and why a lot of the trucks coming out now to Euro emissions standards, even from companies like Kenworth are pushing Cabovers, with the bonnet trucks being more focused on the heavy lifting (Like the T909 being aimed at Road Train work and the Mack Titan being targeted at Heavy Haulage) where economy and emissions aren't as much of a concern?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "My Diploma thesis was about the driving dynamics of \"Gigaliners\" and I had my share of discussions about this.  drivers mostly prefer Bonnet trucks - but they do not really fit European roads. The Length limit was mentioned already - this limit is motivated by politics (to help train transport) and by the roads, which are much narrower in terms of corners and cities. Additionally to the 12m limit, the BO-Kraft-Circle is defining limits for trucks, thats a circular track with an outer radius of 12,5m and an inner radius of 5,3m. The complete truck has to do a complete 360° circle withou crossing one of the diameters.  the new Bonnet trucks the EU is considering are not comparable to the US ones, the \"bonnet\" would be very short, main target is to improve visibility for the drivers, not so much aerodynamics.  This is extremely difficult with longer trucks - and not being able to would limit your truck more or less to the highways as every intersection, curve or crossing is based on this circle.  And in the end load capacity is the most valuable thing, so nobody will accept shorter trailers for the sake of a bonnet.  and in the end, fuel efficiency depens much less on tractor aero than you may think, as an example you gain a big step by shaping the trailer end aerodynamically - but this would cost space of several pallets and limit door size.  A sign is that most of the concepts for optimized aerodynamics use cabovers as well."

Claussen is not fermented but is probably the best of the rest.  Making pickles is stupid easy.   Cover cukes (or most other veggies) with a 2% salt to water solution.   Add flavoring agents. (garlic, dill, bay, peppercorns).  Add something with tannin to help keep the pickles crisp: (grape leaves, horseradish leaves, lots of other stuff.)   Store-bought jarred grape leaves in the Greek section of the store work fine.  Keep the air out to discourage mold. (Air locks work best, but a plate for a weight and plastic wrap can work.  When it has bubbled for a couple of days at room temp, taste.  If you like it put the whole thing in the fridge where it will continue to develop flavor more slowly. If it needs to be more sour, leave it at room temp longer.  If you want the best cucumber pickles use the small kirby's from your farmer's market."

I'm Dr. Lindsay Chervinsky, here to discuss my new book 'The Cabinet: George Washington and the Creation of an American Institution' and early Presidential history, AMA!  **The U.S. Constitution never established a presidential cabinet—the delegates to the Constitutional Convention explicitly rejected the idea. So how did George Washington create one of the most powerful bodies in the federal government?**  On November 26, 1791, George Washington convened his department secretaries—Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, Henry Knox, and Edmund Randolph—for the first cabinet meeting. Why did he wait two and a half years into his presidency to call his cabinet? Because the U.S. Constitution did not create or provide for such a body. Washington was on his own.  Faced with diplomatic crises, domestic insurrections, and constitutional challenges—and finding congressional help lacking—Washington decided he needed a group of advisors he could turn to. He modeled his new cabinet on the councils of war he had led as commander of the Continental Army. In the early days, the cabinet served at the president’s pleasure. Washington tinkered with its structure throughout his administration, at times calling regular meetings, at other times preferring written advice and individual discussions.  *The Cabinet* reveals the far-reaching consequences of Washington’s choice. The tensions in the cabinet between Hamilton and Jefferson heightened partisanship and contributed to the development of the first party system. And as Washington faced an increasingly recalcitrant Congress, he came to treat the cabinet as a private advisory body to summon as needed, greatly expanding the role of the president and the executive branch.\nAnswer: ",

Is there any way to get rid of the bitter taste?

If you really want to stir the pot, type up a resignation letter and instead of putting a date two weeks out,say,   “This letter is to notify you of my intent to leave XYZ Company. My resignation is effective immediately as I do not feel safe working here.”   Take any company owned equipment and leave it with HR and walk out the door.   Don’t even engage with your boss.

    "sft_answer": "As others have said, there are veterinarians who perform house calls for euthanasia. This may be difficult to arrange at the moment due to COVID.   To answer your question about why euthanasias are only done by veterinarians in this case, it has to do with our current standards of practice for companion animal medicine (pets rather than farm animals or wildlife). The AVMA, which is the national regulatory veterinary body, puts forth specific guidelines for euthanasia to be performed ethically and humanely. The focus for us as vets is to minimize any pain or suffering felt by the animal during the procedure. Most vets in the states use an overdose of an anesthetic drug to achieve this. These drugs are strictly controlled by the DEA and thus cannot be dispensed out for use by a client as such.   I’m sorry that you’re going through the loss of a fur baby. Cancer sucks 😢.

    "sft_question": "Question: My partner [27/F] has some serious issues with her back passage and we don't know what to do. (Attempt 2) I posted this 15 days ago and got no responses. I'm gonna try again because I really want some answers to this.  Apologies if my explanation of what's going on goes a little all over the place, I'm not really sure what the best way to go about explaining everything is, but I did the best I could to get things as coherant and understandable as possible while explaining as much as I can about everything that's happening.  Feel free to offer any feedback on how I can re-word this to explain things better or ask any clarification questions you may have.  And please carefully read the whole thing before you comment any suggestions or anything. Thank you.  &#x200B;  About three years ago now, my partner developed a health problem.  It started out small but just kept getting worse and worse and causing other issues alongside it, and now everything's just gotten extremely bad.  &#x200B;  Let's get the medical details out of the way first. We don't know my partner's current weight (though she is a bit on the chubby side), her height is about 6 foot, she doesn't smoke, doesn't drink any alcohol, doesn't take any drugs, not currently taking any medicine and has no known current medical issues (except maybe some undiagnosed anxiety issues)  &#x200B;  Okay so let's start with the symptoms of my partner's health problem. They are as follows;  **Symptom 1)** Yellow or brown (Or somewhere in between) liquid (Not watery, more mucus-y) discharge (Before you say it, it's not diarrhea or constipation) from the butthole that takes more than one roll of toilet paper to wipe off before it stops. Especially after going number 2. It just never seems to stop coming after a number 2. Every time she wipes, there's discharge.  It's gotten to the point of where she doesn't bother to keep wiping until it finally decides to completely stop, but rather get it down to where it's only a little bit coming out and then move on to other things while she waits for it to eventually stop on its own.  This discharge doesn't always appear when going number 1, I think.  We are using wet wipes as a replacement for TP to clean things up but it still takes several packets a day. So it's either spend a few quid on a big packet of TP daily or spend a few quid on several packs of wet wipes daily.  Works out to more or less the same amount of money spent over the same period of time either way.  **Symptom 2)** Tiny specks of what we can only assume is fecal matter being deposited from her butthole into her buttcrack. Again, taking multiple rolls of paper to remove. And she fears if she doesn't remove them they'll just fall off into her clothes and onto everywhere she walks, sits and lays in bed.  They appear every time she goes number 1 except for roughly a day-long period immediately following going number 2, which suggests they're from any amount of fecal matter that's formed in her intestines.  These specks are so small that they are not visible to the naked eye unless you look really closely.  &#x200B;  She spends about an hour in the bathroom every time she goes number 1, and at least 3 hours when she goes number 2, and 99% of both time periods is JUST so she can clean herself up after the actual deed.  It drains all her time and energy every single day. She's too exhausted to do anything other than sit on the couch and do stuff on the laptop.  This leaves me to have to keep on top of all the chores...and as you can imagine being one person dealing with chores generated from two people is not easy, especially when one of those people is generating way more than the normal amount of trash because of their health issues.  She's been to a few different doctors a number of times about her issues. They've done blood tests, put a camera up her rear and tested a fecal matter sample. Every single test revealed nothing abnormal.  The doctors are clueless. One even suggested it's all in her head and wanted to send her to a phsychiarist. No, it is NOT all in her head. These are real, physical symptoms she's having. I've seen the discharge myself on a number of occasions.  They also keep asking if it's diarrhea or constipation for some reason, but it's neither of those.  It's like they just don't understand what we're trying to tell them. We feel like we're not able to explain our issues to them properly so they can fully understand what's going on. It doesn't help that normal GP appointments only have a short period of allotted time to talk to the doctor in, so we can't get the full story out.  We're also concerned they think she's making all this up just to get out of having to find a job.  And because her issue takes up all her time and energy, we rarely have the chance to make regular appointments to talk to the doctor more and maybe try some other tests to see if they can finally determine what's going on.  &#x200B;  We have a few theories as to what could be affecting her but they're just theories. We're obviously not medical experts or anything. I'll put them in order from most likely culprit to least;  **Theory 1) Irratable Bowel Syndrome.**  This was suggested to us by someone we confided with in real life who just so happened to have IBS themselves and recognised the symptoms.  At the time, the symptoms did seem to match up. The discharge, at the time my partner was feeling like she didn't get rid of everything every time she went number 2, stomach cramps...I don't remember what else...  Another thing that points towards IBS is that, before her health issues arose, my partner has actually had the discharge appear throughout her life on very rare occasions, only much smaller amounts which cleared away with normal toilet paper usage, which suggests some kind of genetic issue that we can put somewhere under the IBS umbrella.  However, we scoured the internet and asked around a little bit regarding IBS but could not for the life of us find any mention of the tiny fecal specks.  In fact, it's as if the tiny fecal specks symptom doesn't exist AT ALL in any known medical ailment. At least, not as far as we can find.  **Theory 2) Toilet usage issues messed up her digestive tract.**  When my partner and I first started living together, we spent over a year sharing a house and a single bathroom with two other people.  And just about any time my partner used the bathroom during this time, one or both of the other two other people would come to the bathroom, find it occupied, tut, sigh, and then go back from whence they came while they wait for it to be unoccupied again.  Hearing them tutting and sighing caused my partner to become self-concious about her toilet usage and it discouraged her from using the bathroom as often as she needed, especially for number 2s.  She ended up holding number 2s way longer than she should, making them build up into huge toilet-clogging monsters which only worsened the issue.  We think her holding her number 2s like this might have messed up her internal pipes somewhere somehow.  When they had a look in there with the camera, they didn't really go very deep from what I saw on the diagram they provided afterwards. The damage could be further up where the camera didn't see.  Either that or holding so much for so long reprogrammed her chute to behave in this abnormal way and re-educating it back to normal will be difficult.  The only issue with this explanation is when we moved out of the living situation with those other two people into a place of our own, for the first couple of weeks there my partner's number 2s were actually perfectly normal. No issues whatsoever. Then one day, she found the discharge on her underwear. And that's where it all started about 3 years ago.  **Theory 3) Fecal Impaction**  We recently found this when looking up the question of if it's possible for your bowel movements to damage your bowels, and a lot of the symptoms seemed to line up with what my partner's been experiencing.  It could very well explain the particles...a bit of number 2 constantly stuck at the end of the chute or something like that...it would make sense...right?  I don't know if that's something they would spot when they went in with the camera that time though...  **Theory 4) A drastic change in diet messed up her digestive tract.**  My partner is originally from Romania, where she enjoyed healthy homemade food served to her by her family for every meal on a daily basis and she very rarely had any fast food.  Before she came to England, she was warned by a friend of hers that had already visited a few times that we pretty much only had fast food in our supermarkets.  I guess she wasn't prepared for just how true that statement is. In an instant she went from a healthy nutritious diet of daily homemade meals to having what amounts to something outta McDonalds every lunch and dinner.  She has no idea where to even look for the healthier homemade stuff she used to have, and neither do I.  Like jeez, England, get your culinary stuff together. I was having this stuff my whole life and never realised it wasn't normal until my partner told me when we got together. Nobody said anything to me until then, not even my parents. Heck, my parents even FED me that stuff when I was younger.  What's more, anything healthier is pretty darn expensive for the amount you get.  Healthier foods seriously need to be made more readily available for cheaper. No question about it.  **Theory 5) Dehydration.**  We reckon my partner is not getting enough liquid into her system. She has told me on multiple occasions she feels she needs to drink more than she is doing.  This is confirmed by the fact her number 2s are often quite dark, which is a sign of lack of hydration.  Unfortunately there's another issue preventing her from trying to drink more.  As well as the fact that her main health issues are causing her to spend an hour in the toilet every time she goes number 1, she's also been getting an occasional occurrence of periods of time where she constantly feels the need to go number 1, even from literally the split second after she just finished going number 1. She does try to squeeze out whatever's in there, but nothing comes out, and she still feels the need to go.  So she ends up finishing with the toilet while feeling the need to go number 1, and then going about her day until she's sure she has some liquid in there again, rinse, and repeat.  This constant feeling of needing to go has lead her to...have accidents on multiple occasions, especially when she's trying to wake up in the morning.  Like, as soon as she gets out of bed she has to rush to the toilet. But sometimes she's not fast enough to avoid drenching her garments.  The cold seems to make it much, much worse as well. She's always had a cold sensitivity but once she got these health issues, her feeling cold causes her bladder to go crazy.  And when she goes number 2, at the same time she finds herself going number 1 three or four times in a row, and then two or three more times while she's cleaning up after.  We have no idea where her bladder is getting all this liquid from. We're pretty confident she's outputting way more liquid than she's drinking each day.  In fact she seems to need to go as soon as she drinks something, like the drink is just going right through her.  We do suspect a UTI is at play, possibly brought on by her main health issue somehow.  So with her going number 1 or feeling the need to go number 1 all the time, and having to spend an hour every time, being motivated to drink more is pretty darn difficult.  **Theory 6) Stress**  The health problem may have been started by stress. And then she's stressing about the health problem. Aaaand hello vicious cycle.  **Theory 7) She's doing something wrong with wiping herself.**  This is a theory she has but one that I feel makes no sense. She has this idea that somehow she's doing something wrong with how she's wiping with the toilet paper and that's what's bringing out the discharge and the particles.  I have no idea how you can even do something wrong. You wipe along your crack. That's pretty much it. How can you get that wrong? I dunno.  I think those are all the theories we've come up with so far. So yeah, we think the problem could be any one of those theories, or even a combination of them.  &#x200B;  Moving on, I should mention my partner is a bit of a cleanliness freak. So much so she absolutely refuses to sit on the porcelean throne without covering it in clean toilet paper first. She's convinced it's always dirty, no matter how much it's actually cleaned.  But with her issue with number 1s she's always ending up needing to go really, really bad like she can't hold it another minute so she has no time to cover the seat with paper,  So instead she goes number 1 just crouching over the toilet. So she's also standing the whole 1 hour it takes her to use the bathroom.  She's not just cleaning her buttcrack and/or her peepee hole either, she also cleans her buttcheeks and all down her legs, because she's convinced she's got those particles I talked about earlier falling all over those areas every time she uses the bathroom.  I don't know if that's actually happening, since I can't exactly watch what's happening to her in the bathroom. (It's way too small for two people to occupy)  That's not to mention each time she goes number 1 the liquid trickles down her legs each time. Oh, and obviously if she has an accident she has to clean that off her legs.  I have to help out as well by bringing packs of wet wipes and handing her the wet wipes for her to use. She always ends up using up a whole pack for number 1 and several packs (varying from 4 up to 8, sometimes more, depending on how bad the discharge decides to be) for number 2.  Here's another thing, she has to use so much toilet paper that it doesn't even fit in the toilet bowl, she has to use trash bins. And we live in an apartment block with a trash chute that's only big enough to fit shopping carrier bag sized trash bags.  So we have to have two small trash bins in the bathroom for all the toilet paper and wet wipes she uses, and every time she uses the bathroom she fills them to overflowing and it sometimes falls off onto the floor, and then she stresses about it blowing dirt from the floor and the fallen trash onto her, so she ends up cleaning herself even more from that, creating even more trash to put on the already overflowing trash bins!  I have suggested a third bin to help alleviate things but she doesn't think there's enough space. Her feet sometimes accidentally kick the two that's there already as it is.  And that's just from going number one. When she goes number two, about halfway through the whole ordeal we actually have to take the time for her to empty the bins of the full bags, give them to me to dispose of, and then have me give her fresh empty bags to put in the bins, and then she proceeds to fill and overflow those too before she's finished!  And we have to use gloves for this. In fact we have to use gloves for pretty much everything when she goes number two, so I have to bring her gloves to use!  Mostly gloves for the wet wipes to wipe her crack with. She doesn't want to get naked fingers covered in ass discharge while she's cleaning, obviously.  Also when she goes number two, she HAS to change all her clothes to a clean set, no question. Again, with gloves.  Also she has to put two period pads onto her underwear to be able to cover all three...\"exits\", hoping they'll catch anything that might otherwise fall onto her clothes.  As you can imagine, all this toilet paper, wet wipes and period pads causes a serious drain on our already lacking funds...and obviously we can't get any jobs while we're dealing with these health issues.  Also, all this standing around in the bathroom causes a lot of leg and back pain and she never really has time to recover before she needs the bathroom again so it's just steadily getting worse and worse and causing more and more pain.  When she goes walking, she worries about when she walks normally, her period pads feel like they're moving side to side and uncovering her butt crack and letting particles got into her pants, so to keep them centered as much as possible she does this weird slow stiff walk that only causes even more pain.  Lately she's been complaining about not having the physical strength to continue cleaning herself whenever she's in the toilet. She's not just talking about each partcular time, either, she means in general she feels like the time she spends in the toilet is draining her physical strength more and more.  She says she feels like she's just going to collapse in the bathroom one day, a thing she really doesn't want to happen, especially during number 2, because the floor is not clean at all, it's likely got those particles all over it and more often than not there's a puddle in front of the toilet as well from her not being able to hold number 1, and she doesn't know how to clean herself up after that. Wet wipes won't be enough and she'll be at the point where just jumping in the shower will just not be physically possible.  What's more she could get seriously injured from the collapse, possibly even to a fatal degree if she hits her head on something hard and unforgiving.  In general she's in fear of her life, that something's just gonna give and she's just gonna die from all this strain her body's being put through, and we feel absolutely powerless to stop it from happening.  I really can't stress enough just how bad it is. She keeps talking about how she's losing her mind and how she can't keep going on like this and she keeps yelling at the universe to just fluffing kill her already if that's what all this is leading to.  She also gets upset that she feels she ruined my life by coming into it, and I have to reassure her that's not the case. (I ruined my life plenty already by being a lazy piece of whatever before I met her)  Sometimes she gets so upset she wants to go kill herself somehow, and I have to try and help calm her down. But it's getting harder and harder each time. One time recently she got so upset she stormed off right out of our apartment and made it down four floors of stairs before I could get her to stop and calm down.  So I guess my question is this;  What the heck health issue is plaguing my partner, and how do we effectively communicate to a doctor in real life what's going on?\nAnswer: ",

However, I'd like to hear the opposition's response to what he's saying.  Also, critiques of social liberalism are welcome. Thanks for your help!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "There's a lot that's been said about the implausibility of the original position. Here are two criticisms.   First, Rawls fiats that parties behind the veil of ignorance know the \"basic truths\" of human psychology, sociology, political science, economics, and so on. Critics point out that there are hardly established truths in these fields, and so Rawls is caught in a dilemma: either enumerate exactly what these truths are (and thus open himself to criticism on this front) or don't, rendering his theory too formal to be of use. The idea here is that Rawls has really punted the difficult questions of social organization down the line while giving the impression that he's come to substantive conclusions. For example, he himself thinks his theory supports both socialist and capitalist modes of organization. If a theory of political organization doesn't decide between something so fundamental to the structure of a society, then what good can it be? (says the critic).  Second, Rawls thinks that there's going to be *deliberation* behind the veil of ignorance which leads to conclusions about the structure of society. But, given that parties behind the original position are formally identical (e.g. minimally rational, with no contingent features influencing their decisionmaking, etc.), it's hard to imagine what this deliberation would look like. It'd be like one person deliberating with themselves. But what does that even mean? Surely they would just agree with themselves, on pain of self-contradiction.   I believe Robert Paul Wolff's *Understanding Rawls* makes these critiques."

It’s probably a better idea to try and mellow out the sweetness by adding some acid, salt, or umami to the cake.   Acid wise might be a bit difficult (as it would react with the baking soda) but you could maybe add some in the frosting (lemon cream cheese could go nicely). Salt is simple, just add a bit more than you would normally. Umami/savoy could be boosted by adding herbs, rosemary could work, although you obviously have to keep in mind the flavours that they would also add to the dish."

It is confusing that I am allowed to humanely process my own meat, but there isn't an option for me to humanely say goodbye to a loving pet.   In my state, we can even humanely provide suicide to a loved human who is near death.  I AM NOT asking how to do it. Nor do I suggest everyone should do it. I am simply wondering why we haven't evolved to offering this choice?  Thank you.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "As others have said, there are veterinarians who perform house calls for euthanasia. This may be difficult to arrange at the moment due to COVID.   To answer your question about why euthanasias are only done by veterinarians in this case, it has to do with our current standards of practice for companion animal medicine (pets rather than farm animals or wildlife). The AVMA, which is the national regulatory veterinary body, puts forth specific guidelines for euthanasia to be performed ethically and humanely. The focus for us as vets is to minimize any pain or suffering felt by the animal during the procedure. Most vets in the states use an overdose of an anesthetic drug to achieve this. These drugs are strictly controlled by the DEA and thus cannot be dispensed out for use by a client as such.   I’m sorry that you’re going through the loss of a fur baby. Cancer sucks 😢. Wishing you the best.  Edit: spelling"

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: People shouldn’t ever celebrate vigilante justice I think that the internet has a problem with people disrespecting systems that are in place to enact justice, and immorally applauding vigilante justice. Every time a post is made on social media about someone, for example, killing the alleged murderer or rapist of their loved ones the comments are cheering on their vigilante justice and I think this is a problem.   To be clear, I’m not saying that the revenge was or wasn’t deserved in any particular case. My reasons to believe that vigilante justice shouldn’t ever be celebrated are as follows:  I believe that crimes are equal in immorality regardless of the relationship between perpetrator and victim. The murder of a rapist or a murderer shouldn’t be judged any less severely than that of, say, an innocent child.  While I do believe that rehabilitation is one of the purposes of punitive systems, their primary purpose is, and should be, punishment. This point is made to address comments like  *“‘\"\\[...\\] got off with only 5 years probation.’ The judge believed that sending Gary to jail would benefit no one and he was unlikely to commit another crime. The judge was right too, he didn't hurt anyone after this.”*  I don’t think that whether someone will or won’t commit crime again is the only factor that should go into consideration when deciding their punishment. Regardless of their motivations, one who has access to a government that enforces the law, and rather than relying on those systems chooses to kill another person, is a murderer like any other.  Any form of vigilante justice undermines the judicial systems already in place. If you wish to be protected by the law, then it is up to the law, and not you, to decide who is and isn’t guilty and how they should be prosecuted.  Internet comments on topics like this are often emotionally driven, with little thought put into them, but that doesn’t change the fact that support of vigilante justice is often the prevailing sentiment, and that that is harmful. Vigilante justice undermines the foundation of the sound and reasonably reliable judicial systems of the developed world. It can very easily lead to the death of innocent people, and even if only the guilty are killed, that can hardly be called justice. I can empathize with how an emotionally driven immediate response may be supporting a person taking revenge on the alleged perpetrator of an egregious act on them or their loved ones, but such support is inevitably supporting murderers and other criminals who are hardly better than the people they seek revenge on.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_question": "Question: Is it morally justified to commit suicide? Now, this discussion question is partly a response to Camus’ “The Myth of Sisyphus”. (For those who are unfamiliar) Here, Camus essentially tries to answer one of the most fundamental philosophical questions: Should I commit suicide? Or in other words: Is life worth living? His answer goes something like this: Yes, life is worth living, but it is your responsibility to find meaning in life, and from that meaning it is your responsibility to find happiness (please refute me if you disagree with this summary).   Now, don’t get me wrong, this single philosophical work has changed my life—it is my Bible. However, I disagree that he answers the question on whether life is worth living. I understand that Camus is partly meaning “philosophical suicide”; this distinction allows his argument and allegory to be sound. But in the beginning, he specifically meant literally ending your life. Since Sisyphus (a man condemned to push a Boulder up a hill for eternity, only for it to fall back down every day) has no option to commit suicide, his only logical option is to simply enjoy his suffering, thus tricking the gods for eternity.   But what if Sisyphus COULD choose to commit suicide (in the Atheist sense) and therefore cease to exist? Would this option disallow—or make it more difficult for—Sisyphus to find meaning and happiness in his suffering?   Additionally, in a practice sense: Do I own my body? If so, why can’t I commit suicide without any moral consequences? Since suicide is illegal, doesn’t that mean that the State owns my body? Furthermore, doesn’t the idea that suicide is selfish even more so indicate that the collective owns my body?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I think Camus was saying that if one commits suicide, it would mean that the person answered the question of life’s meaning, because only then can you rationally decide whether the meaning is worth it or not. But Camus says that it is impossible to answer this question because of the absurdity of life which he compares to Sisyphus’s task. I think you’re a little confused in the sense that you think of Sisyphus’s act as “suffering”. As far as I understand Camus, he is in fact suggesting that it is impossible to know whether Sisyphus’s task is truly even suffering or not, but it is surely absurd. Acknowledging this fact and the fate of it conquers it and therefore you can live in content acceptance."

Hi everyone, so I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering but since the final year of my degree that I've wanted to pursue a career as a software developer. Since I have basic knowledge in Visual Basic, C and Java, I talked to the main professor of the masters degree program in COMP SCI, at my university, and he told me that I could enroll in, as long as I took the 4 main classes from the undergrad curriculum. Those classes are \" Software engineering\", \"Data Bases\", \"Systems Architecture\" and \"Intro to programming\". So my question is, Do u think I should enroll in the masters program, or do something else ?  Extra: In my country the masters program is 2 years long and the tuitions aren´t as crazy as in the US.  Sorry if my English is not perfect, it's not my main language.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Switching to software development is probably less complicated and formal than you think.  As an Electronics Engineer, I've done firmware and software development, including at a web- and app-development firm.  Or my brother, for instance, had only a semester of college and worked as a video editor at several news organizations. He recently decided \"Naw, this isn't going anywhere\" and is currently in the latter half of a coding bootcamp.  At the web-development firm I worked in, a couple of them came from bootcamps. To my frustration, making pretty much the same as me. One of the guys I worked with closely never got a degree or formal training, but left the company to do his own contracts and make well into six figures.  Oh, and our resident \"AI Expert\" had a degree in physics and started at the company doing QA testing.  With software, the skills count almost entirely and formal education counts for comparatively little. Mind you, having an engineering degree under your belt will IMMEDIATELY make you stand out and get your foot in the door. In my experience, people respected my EE degree more than others' CS degrees.

Or do I just submit the report and wash my hands of the situation?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "We warn them by policy: any student caught in a violation is required to meet with the professor, who writes up a formal statement of the \"charges\" and evidence. The professor, the student, and a witness (usually the department chair) sign a form that says they have all reviewed the charges. The student can either agree that yes. they did it, or they can appeal-- but they have to sign the form acknowledging the charges and the penalty, which can range from failing the assignment to failing the entire course. The form and evidence then go to the dean's office. If it happens twice in their college career they risk expulsion.  As a department chair I like the system because it 1) ensures the student does indeed know they have been caught and face consequences, and 2) eliminates any questions about the charges. Parents can't call and say \"My  Johnny would never cheat!\" and students can't claim \"I didn't know \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ was a violation!\" because it is all documented. I'd say 9/10 students almost immediately admit their wrongdoing when we meet to do the paperwork; the few that do not usually end their appeal when they meet with the dean, who will always back up the faculty/chair in academic dishonesty cases that are documented. Tears are not uncommon at this stage (from the students), though 4/5 of the accused tend to be male on our campus. Most of them claim they were too busy or overwhelmed, so took \"short cuts\" that resulted in plagiarism...in 20+ years at my current school my department has never had a case of cheating that \\*wasn't\\* some form of plagiarism (no exam cheats or anything like that)."

It's selfish not to.  **2- WHAT ABOUT RELIGIOUS BELEIFS**- Does your religious beliefs also require you to not accept a donated organ and instead go to the afterlife? Or is this a case of My body is too sacred to save someone else, but someone else body can be used to save me!  If it's the former then fine you have a fair point and a consistent view that the body after death caries significance and thus should not be messed with. Thus you will follow that to your grave.  If its the later you have no standing, and your argument is full of crap, you can't have it both ways, either the body is important to the soul and thus must be left alone and so taking part of someone's body to heal yourself if sacrilegious or its not.  **3- PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO THEIR OWN BODY**- Correct in life, not in death to value the dead over the living is immoral.

I do not throw that word around, and I do not mean it as an insult, I literally mean he is a fascist.     Let me first expose why I don’t believe he is a Republican or has Republican values: 1.\tDonald Trump is “very pro choice”.  He stated this in an interview in 1999 on Meet The Press. 2.\tDonald Trump has a very limited knowledge of the Bible.  I know this is a stretch, but the GOP in the US has very strong Biblical beliefs, and many of their stances are based around said book (against gay marriage, pro life, etc).  This came to fruition when he mispronounced II Corinthians as “two Corinthians”, and even more so when he stated he never asked for forgiveness because he doesn’t do anything bad. 3.\tDonald Trump wants to expand government’s power over it’s citizens, not reduce it.  He stated last year that he’s a fan of Eminent Domain, and is actively using it to acquire land near the Mexican border for his wall.  Through his cutting back of funding for the EPA (which educates and provides regulations that keep air and water more clean), the Department of Education, and the Department of Labor.     My support for him being a fascist: 1.\tHis leaning towards a corporatist economic system.  He is promoting massive tax cuts for wealthy companies, but hardly touching small, 100 employees or less companies.  Removing the restrictions of Dodd-Frank, which protects individuals from predatory lending and collection practices is one such move. 2.\tAttempting to discredit media.  We can all agree that MSM has it’s own agenda, that really isn’t what’s up for discussion here.  What is, however, is his attempt to decide what is “true” and “fake” news.  He has labeled CNN as “Fake News”, while praising Fox and Friends.  He seems to do this not on a basis of fact/fiction, but on a basis of whether or not they agree with him.  Just yesterday, during the FBI and NSA hearings, he called the hearings “Fake News” even though they were literally happening while he was tweeting about it.  He is attempting to claim a monopoly on the truth. 3.\tPower through military.  His budget proposal cuts social welfare programs, environmental protection programs, and education programs to bolster our already large military.   4.\tAttempting to discredit other branches of government.  We all remember that “SEE YOU IN COURT!” tweet he put out as he lost a court battle regarding the banning of people from certain nations, but the courts aren’t the only one.  He has bashed Congress several times over the past few years, and especially during the election.  Claiming the courts are “liberal” (ie. Against what he wants) if they find him wrong, and supporting those that agree with him. 5.\tHis history of alleged sexual abuse.  Mussolini labeled women as “reproducers of the nation” and recommended against employing them.  It’s almost as though Trump shares this view and sees them as objects rather than human beings.  Whether it’s walking into the changing rooms at pageants or “grabbing them by the *****”, or the several allegations of sexual misconduct against him, we have to admit his history with women is a bit rocky at best. 6.\tRacial/National division.  Trump has repeatedly kicked minorities out of his rallies, including some who claim to have been legitimately there to learn his stances.  His quotes on people from Mexico and Muslims go without saying as well.  “A ban on all Muslims from entering the country” is one of his campaign promises.  Most people will say “Muslim’s aren’t a race”, but let me clarify: a race is just a shared characteristic between groups of people.  It doesn’t have to be physical color.  It can be nationality, religion, skin color, disability, etc. I am posting this here legitimately out of trying to understand where he stands.

I love breakfast sandwiches, but absolutely despise the structural integrity of most of them. Cheese obviously helps keep the sandwich together , but it only goes so far.   I’m wondering if there’s a viable way to have the meat, cheese, and egg elements assembled in a raw dough to prevent sandwich slippage? This sounds eerily similar to a breakfast style hot pocket, but I’d like to refrain from hard scrambled eggs and instead get a soft baked egg that will still be slightly runny after it’s time in the oven.   Would it be a crime against nature to freeze an egg, peel it, then add it into the center or a bread dough to bake? Could a biscuit dough work? Would soft boiling said egg be a potential work around?   I’m a simple man who just wants a runny breakfast sandwich, without the frustration of my top bun sliding away from my bottom bun.

When one of them starts getting ambitious, reveal to him that there is another candidate for apprenticeship and he must kill that other candidate in order to maintain his position. If he succeeds or fails, the stronger apprentice will reveal himself. Then look for another apprentice to cultivate and start over again — or try to, anyway, since your apprentice will be on the hunt for you soon enough."

My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was \"acting like a slut\" and \"dressing inappropriately\" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent \"promiscuity\". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because \"[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.\"  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a \"you're starting high school\" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again.

You are saying that being black makes women inherently unattractive to you, regardless of their personal qualities. What makes being black such an important quality that it’s worth avoiding dating someone over that specifically if it’s not rooted in some kind of prejudice against black women?  > I think it’s same concept as for example if a gay person says they would not want to date a women ,is it because they believe there is something wrong with women ,no it’s cause they don’t find them attractive and I dont think that makes gays  Homosexuality is mostly innate. Race preferences are not. They are influenced by personal and societal prejudices that shape how we view ideal standards of beauty. For a very long time, black women have been deemed universally undesirable because of deeply ingrained biases against them in our media and culture. The pinnacle of female beauty has always centered around white women, specifically, in contrast to black women. Meanwhile women of other races and ethnicities, such as Asians and (non-black) Latinas, are hyperfetishized, which isn’t any better. So no, saying you’re not attracted to black women is not like being gay. It is a result of centuries of black women being depicted as less desirable than other races."

Everyone seems to think that advancements in technology are great, but that we need to avoid this dystopian future that we're heading towards. They think it would be depressing if no-one interacted in the real world anymore and were simply hooked up to a machine that stimulated our brains, or simulated a virtual existence. Let's assume this is a perfect system that can affect our brain however it chooses, keeping us alive indefinitely (or at least as long as you'd live otherwise). People who I tend to follow/agree with talk about it like this would be a nightmare future we should avoid.  &#x200B;  My arguments against this:  \\- Anything you feel is lost by this, you wouldn't feel. If you're seeking feeling some kind of genuine experience, where some suffering is required to reach an overall earned outcome, you would feel this. Your genuinity sensors are firing on overdrive, more than you could experience in the 'real' world.  \\- All positive experiences can be exaggerated to an otherwise impossible extent. What we think of as the peak happiness/experience could be 0.00001% of what this system makes us feel. No matter what your brains preferred state is.  \\- In all likelihood, what we consider the 'real' world is probably some form of illusion anyway. Whether it's organic (some form of universe 'creating' this one as an illusion), artificial (a simulation in the mathematical/computational sense), organic-artificial (eg. a 'dream'), or any kind of solipsism. It's definitely another topic to argue why this is the case, but the starting point should be assuming it's one of the many possibilities of a non-reality, rather than blindly assuming it's the one real top-level genuine reality. But that aside, if you believed the world was an illusion in some form, would it not be better to go one level deeper if it meant you felt a more positive experience?  \\- Any feeling of 'greater good' you have, or feeling/intention about continuing the human race and ensuring our survival, you will feel that but to a more satisfying extent. Or, we could assume that's taken care of by the system we're plugged into.  \\- This direct brain manipulation could mean that you perceive existence for much longer. Similar to how people report that with certain drugs, their time 'under' feels a lot longer than realtime (I think DMT is an example of this). So not only are you experiencing an infinitely better existence, it can feel infinitely longer.  &#x200B;  I'm not trying to persuade anyone of the likelihood of this or how feasible it is, and I'm assuming certain 'features' of this system that might be unrealistic.

We'll be here today at 2 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM), about the present and future of STIs.  STIs are an enormous health issue. According to the [World Health Organization, there are approximately 1 million new infections daily worldwide, resulting in 2.3 million deaths every year. In the United States, half of new STIs occur among those ages 15-24. Meanwhile, increases in antimicrobial resistance are making it harder to treat and cure infections. STIs also represent a massive burden to the economy- in the United States alone, $16 billion is spent annually on STI-related health care costs.  But it's not all bad news! Screening programs are increasing around the world, mother to child transmission rates of diseases such as chlamydia, syphilis and HIV are decreasing, and effective treatments are continuing to be developed and delivered to patients in need. Even better, new technologies, some of which were created rapidly as part of the national COVID-19 response effort, are making it easier for people to access routine sexual health maintenance services.  We're here to answer your questions and discuss causes and cures, as well as opportunities for improvements in diagnoses and prevention strategies. We'll also discuss the emergence of new diseases and how they can be contained.  PLEASE NOTE- WE WILL NOT BE MAKING PERSONAL DIAGNOSES OR RECOMMENDING TREATMENTS.

    "sft_answer": "In my experience, gay culture in big cities unfortunately prefers unsafe sex over using a condom, as such I can only imagine there’s a large number of guys out there who need antibiotic treatments rather frequently.   Are there long term implications — not just for individual patients but for the population as a whole — for the reliance on antibiotic treatments rather than protected sex when it comes to “maintaining” sexual health?

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered. One thing I will say isn’t going to change my mind: anecdotes of “my school already teaches this” unless you can show me that it’s already happening in a large number of schools.\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_answer": "So it all starts with the Greeks, though there is evidence it's even further back from that. They looked up at the sky, particularly the moon, and said \"That sure looks round to me... and so does the sun, while we're at it... why WOULDN'T the Earth be?\"  Along comes a smart guy we'll call Eratosthenes because, well, that was his name. He learned that at midday, during the summer solstice in Syene, a stick stuck in the ground didn't cast much of a shadow. So he asked himself \"Eratosthenes, do you think this might be the case here in Alexandria where I am?\" So he did the only sensible thing and stuck a stick in the ground at the same day and time. Lo and behold... there was a shadow. Well.. that's not supposed to happen... So let's look at that shadow... around 7 degrees or so. Interesting.   The Greeks had already figured out that however far away the sun was, it was a long freaking way, and shouldn't have much effect on shadows of sticks. So if the shadow is 7 degrees, and I know how far it is from Syene to Alexandira, then I've got myself a sphere and I can work out how big it is with those numbers.   That's exactly what he did, and he came up with a number that was less than 50 miles of what we now know to be the diameter of the Earth."

In her words \"This is more of a monkey’s paw scenery but if you wish for “flight” odds are you’ll just be able to fly at the same speed you can run, which wouldn’t be super useful. We’re assuming this is just an isolated power so you’d think it’d be linked to how much natural strength you have. You can only run at a set speed so makes sense you can only fly at that speed too before you get tired and have to slow down.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: There should be an age cap that prevents politicians over 70 years old from holding public office. I’m from Britain, but this applies to any country.   As the age of retirement in the UK is 60-65, I believe it is entirely reasonable to stop politicians from serving over the age of 70. In any industry, the retirement of the older generations makes room for others to progress into more experienced roles and new people to enter into the new vacancies. But in politics older politicians, who may have entered in their 50s but have stood for re-election over the next 30 years, continue to serve into their 80s. In the UK, there are multiple politicians who only enter politics because they have retired from their previous careers.  Though it is unquestionable that there have been great older politicians, it is well known that older people generally tend to hold on to values and beliefs from their younger years, and this means politicians in their 70s and 80s are holding on to values and beliefs from 30-60 years ago. Is it any surprise that younger politicians often support modern movements (climate emergency, LGBT+ rights, women’s rights, etc.) more than the older generations?  Out of 650 members of Parliament currently serving in the UK, there are 81 MPs aged over 65, a total of 339 over the age of 50, and only 14 that are aged under 30 (all of whom are unknown because they are in the back benches). Parliament’s role is to do what is right for the country, currently and in the future. With just 2% of MPs aged under 30, how can we justify politicians over the age of 70, who realistically have a limited future, shaping the country that the younger generations must live in?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "First, there's a bit of an issue here in conflating \"entering politics\" with \"becoming an MP.\"  Becoming an MP is not something most entry level politicians do.  Typically you'd run for something like local council first.    This is similar to asking why so few FTSE 100 companies have young CEOs, or why there are so few young Army generals.    Second, and more fundamentally, there's a big problem of democracy in telling people they can't vote for who they want.  One of the core things which makes a democracy legitimate is the fact that the people can choose whomever they like as their representative.    Obviously politicians should not be able to hide their age, and things like date of birth are a pretty normal disclosure requirement as a part of the process of running for office.  But if people want to vote for Jeremy Corbyn despite him being 70, it is not democratically legitimate to deny them that choice."

It seems like they lose most, if not all, of the battles the Republic engages them in Even their top general, General Grievous, seems to be extremely incompetent in military strategy, with him being beat back at almost every turn. Also, their droids are incredibly inaccurate for robots that have a built in aiming system.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "The Separatists are feared for several reasons:  The Republic can't give them a knock-out punch, they keep hanging on battle after battle. People are afraid of any rogue army that takes wild chances, will kill off tens of thousands of troops for no reason, and will brutalize anyone who resists. And the Separatists will always recover after every battle because they can just build more droids. And yet people see their Jedi protectors get fewer and fewer...and Grievous and Dooku are hella scary on their own.      In more detail:      First of all you have to realize Palpatine was not running a conventional war. He was both sides. If one side won, Palpatine *lost*.  Palpatine's goal was to prolong the war (and destabilize the republic enough to gain control) and kill Jedi. Once Palpatine achieved both goals (emergency powers + Order 66) the war was over and it was down to mopping things up. So Grievous had to keep the war burning and kill Jedi and he was great at both.     Who doesn't matter: The clones take time to replace but are essentially irrelevant to the war effort. They are team Palpatine either way so killing them is kind of irrelevant to Palpatine. (and Grievous, whether he knew it or not)      Jedi are who Palpatine *hates.* They stand in the way of his success and he can't fight them all and he could never train enough apprentices to tackle them head-on. Every single Jedi who lives is a big threat to his plans and his personal safety. Luckily there is a very, *very* limited number of Jedi. Force-users are one in a billion, require a lifetime to train to make them effective, have to be constantly retrained to prevent dark-side drift, and each one is essentially irreplaceable. Palpatine will never train enough apprentices to tackle the Jedi head-on. The only way to fight them is to divide them, stoke their inner conflicts, put innocent lives in danger so they take stupid risks, and focus so many blaster bolts at them that they cannot deflect them all and attrition wears them away.      The Separatists (who noticeably have a lot of business/industrial interests) are a custom designed foil for the Jedi with their nearly infinite number of droids. Droids are cheap, suicidally brave even against space-wizards with laser-swords, can be made nearly anywhere on an assembly line, and can fire a blaster. General Grievous can lose a ten-thousand cheap droids and retreat in a battle but along the way if he nails even *one* Jedi than he's doing great! And Palpatine would think that battle was great trade! In this way Grievous could lose every single battle, still remain in the fight and then *win* by steadily thinning out the Jedi.      During any of prequels or associated media do you ever hear about Palpatine complaining \"Grievous you've killed a Jedi but all those droids cost money buddy. We've got a budget you know.\" Nope. Let it rain (droids), nobody cares! As mentioned Palpatine orchestrated the war for those two simple reasons: Cause turmoil with a prolonged conflict so he could seize power, and kill all dem Jedi. The Separatists, Dooku, and Grievous got the job done."

You yourself can actually look into why something works and test it right now because of science. I struggle to think of anything religion has made reality, except maybe science itself.   >To quote Ricky Gervais:  >>Science is constantly proved all the time. You see, if we take something like any fiction, any holy book, and destroyed it, in a thousand years’ time, that wouldn’t come back just as it was.   >>Whereas if we took every science book, and every fact, and destroyed them all, in a thousand years they’d all be back, because all the same tests would [produce] the same result.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "So I see where you're coming from, but I think you're conflating a few concepts.  You're trying to say that atheism equals materialism, which is common enough on the internet, but then trying to also make that equal to science.  If science were the same thing as atheism, then religious people wouldn't really be able to do science.  But there are plenty of very good, and very religious scientists throughout history and even today.  And plenty of nonreligious ones.  Science is really meant to be independent of a number of beliefs, such as religious, political, or moral.  You do the same experiment, you should get the same result.  The example I usually give is that, if atheism is true, then salt will dissolve in water.  If theism is true... well, the same thing happens.  So the fact that science works isn't really evidence for either point of view.  To have materialism without any faith, I'd say you would have to prove that all known phenomena have strictly material causes.  That could happen someday, but it's definitely not happening today.  The most famous example is the hard problem of consciousness.  If you're not familiar with that, I recommend this video on it, which does a really good job of explaining it using a couple thought experiments.  Some people have walked away from materialism because of things like this, such as Thomas Nagel.  If you want to go deeper, you can check out an article like this.  None of this proves that materialism is *wrong*, per se, but it certain shows materialism is *unproven*.  And if you're going to believe in the unproven, then that takes faith.  At least a little."

    "sft_answer": "Try a stabilized whipped cream! Make whipped cream as you normally would, but just before it hits stiff peaks, add either a little gelatin (bloomed in a slurry with as little water as you can manage) or my favorite trick: a spoonful or so of instant vanilla pudding mix. Whip to peaks, and it pipes and tastes like whipped cream, but will hold shape for a day or two. Only real downside is it doesn't hold up to heavy decoration the way buttercream does, and you'll need it chilled if you make it the day before."

So is there anything with which I can replace sugar in recipes to get the same textures without making things overly sweet?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "As others have said, it’s difficult to copy the physical properties of sugar in a cake. It’s probably a better idea to try and mellow out the sweetness by adding some acid, salt, or umami to the cake.   Acid wise might be a bit difficult (as it would react with the baking soda) but you could maybe add some in the frosting (lemon cream cheese could go nicely). Salt is simple, just add a bit more than you would normally. Umami/savoy could be boosted by adding herbs, rosemary could work, although you obviously have to keep in mind the flavours that they would also add to the dish."

    "sft_answer": "# Hidden Valley Ranch Dressing  Is the original ranch dressing and was served at the Hidden Valley Ranch in Santa Barbara CA starting in the mid 50's. So popular was it that Eventually the started a company and started selling it commercially they started selling the dry ingredients in packages and you just added Buttermilk and Mayonnaise.  Eventually they started a company and started selling it commercially, first locally and then nationwide. in 1972 they sold the company to Clorox. Clorox?? Yes.  By the late 70's households didn't usually buy buttermilk any more and he dry mix was adjusted to include \"buttermilk flavoring\"  Ready to use Ranch Dressing was the ultimate goal though. Unfortunately, Buttermilk is a live culture product--like real yogurt. Mixing alive bacterial cultures and bottling them lead to a lot of problems--likie bottles exploding. Year after tear the recipe was changed, massaged, tinkered with and trialed but the only thing that worked was to make the dressing so acidic that the bacteria was killed off. But this made the dressing much less palatable.  By 1983 they had tried so many variations that they essentially said, \"Fuck it, just sell the dressing\". So store bought Ranch was born but is vastly inferior to fresh-made Ranch Dressing--but not many people today know what buttermilk tastes like. So, when you get it at a restaurant where buying a gallon of buttermilk is no big deal and you get fresh Ranch Dressing it tastes nothing like what you can get in a bottle."

When people think of racists, they tend to think of shitty actions only done by racists, like holding oppressive, racist ideologies, or discriminating against certain races without valid reason.  But when it comes to attraction, it's entirely subjective, so yeah, you may observe a bias going this day and that which you don't like, but that's what you gotta work with. Unlike with ideologies, or conscious actions, your preference is not your choice.  So I think it's good for people to **acknowledge** where they're biased, so they can effectively cope with that circumstance. But when it comes to physical attraction, you can't really get around it without eliminating the bias, which is no easy task."

We did turkey until we moved to the US at which point everybody got all turkeyed out but the time thanksgiving was over so now we do goose.

They are then broken into bite sized pieces and boiled. In the last 20 minutes or so you lift the goose, reserve most of the rendered fat, toss the mlinci in the drippings then lay the bird back on.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: anything can and should be joked about in the right context I believe that, in the right context, anything can and should be joked about. To say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things. For example, joking about the Holocaust, while not always situationally appropriate, helps us process the tragedy and reinforces that we won and that we aren’t letting Nazis hold that power over us any more. To say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us, while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to Nazis and Hitler. Essentially, making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics.   Now, I’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics. Don’t make Holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they’re okay with it. Don’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they’re okay with it.  However, if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic, then joke away. In that case, the offended party is in the wrong.   Tl;dr: as long as there’s either nobody with a personal connection to a serious topic or those with the connection give the okay, anything can be joked about.

Here are a few things the hygienist explained to me **beforehand**:  * There was a lot of buildup on my teeth, and I had some bone loss. * My cleaning would be more intense than a \"standard cleaning\".  Here is what the hygienist explained to me **during**:  * The cleaning was taking a while, and due to time, my cleaning would need to be split into two sessions.  It wasn't until **after** they had cleaned only the right side of my mouth that they explained to me the following:  * Because the cleaning was split into two different sessions, they will be billed as two separate cleanings. * Because they are two separate cleanings, I will be billed twice. * Because I am trying to get two separate cleanings within a 6-month period, my insurance will not cover the second cleaning.  That definitely caught me off guard. Nobody goes to get a cleaning expecting only half of their mouth to be cleaned. When they were done, I thought, \"I had half a cleaning today,\" not \"I had a cleaning today.\" I had assumed that because it was the same procedure, I would be billed once for it.  I spoke with another dentist who told me that splitting more intense cleanings into two sessions is a standard practice. Hygienists can make that decision at their own discretion for a variety of reasons (lack of time, comfort of the patient, etc.). I have no problem with that as a concept—I did, after all, agree to come back (before I knew that it would be billed twice).  When I spoke to the insurance company, they told me a few things:  * The dentist could have done it all in one session, and had they done so, I would have been billed once for it, and it would have been covered entirely. * It is the dentist's responsibility to contact the provider service to determine my benefits (which they did not).  I called the dentist office, and they refused to work with me. It feels like they are using my half-clean mouth as leverage. My only two options are to wait 6 months to clean the other half of my mouth or pay for the second cleaning.  I understand that there is nothing wrong with what they did from a dental perspective. My beef is that they did not do their due diligence of determining my benefits or transparently communicate their billing process until after they had already cleaned half of my mouth.

    "sft_question": "Question: How might one approximate the efficiency of freezing water, with a freezer, to heat a house? Just an idea I've had in my mind for a while. With the recent warnings that electricity is gonna be **really** expensive this winter, maybe it's worth a shot.  Basically, just put a big bucket of water in the freezer. Once it's frozen, you throw out all the ice outdoors, and refill the bucket. All the heat that was in the liquid water is now in the house instead, meaning I *must* have gained some free heating. Theoretically, this works great. In practice, I have no idea how to even approach a calculation to determine if it's a reasonable thing to do at all.  Some parts are simple. 10 liters of water seems like a manageable amount. It will provide about 1 kwh as heat as it freezes, plus a non negligible amount from cooling the water. (Enthalpy of fusion=334 kJ/kg, 10 kg = 3.3 MJ = 0.92 kWh.)  But how on earth would I figure out how much energy the freezer will require to freeze said amount? What's the efficiency of a typical freezer compressor?\nAnswer: ",

I use a metal hand whisk and whisk every couple of minutes until the sugar has fully dissolved and my digital thermometer reads 72C. I know since the whites are already pasteurized the temperature check is a little redundant however, it gives me peace of mind.   I immediately take the bowl off the pot a d let it cool for 15 minutes before transferring it to the fridge overnight.   The next day I will use the paddle attachment on my stand mixer and beat the egg white/sugar mix for about 20 minutes on high.

(and at other places tap water doesn't do that seemingly) does anyone has an explanation?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Although the other answers are correct, I don't think they speak to the phenomenon you're asking about exactly.  What you seem to be describing - that sometimes when you leave water sitting in a glass for a long time it forms bubbles on the inside of the glass and sometimes it doesn't - it has to do with the barometric pressure!  Water has gasses like carbon dioxide and oxygen dissolved in it.  When you pour water there's a certain amount in solution.  When the air pressure falls those gasses come out of solution and appear as bubbles on the glass!  As to the change in taste, tap water is usually chlorinated and chlorine evaporates out of water pretty quickly, so that's responsible for some of the change in taste.  Also if you leave it out it tends to absorb CO2 from the air which gives it a bitter-ish taste.  There's probably other chemical changes that I'm not aware of."

So popular was it that Eventually the started a company and started selling it commercially they started selling the dry ingredients in packages and you just added Buttermilk and Mayonnaise.  Eventually they started a company and started selling it commercially, first locally and then nationwide. in 1972 they sold the company to Clorox. Clorox?? Yes.  By the late 70's households didn't usually buy buttermilk any more and he dry mix was adjusted to include \"buttermilk flavoring\"  Ready to use Ranch Dressing was the ultimate goal though. Unfortunately, Buttermilk is a live culture product--like real yogurt. Mixing alive bacterial cultures and bottling them lead to a lot of problems--likie bottles exploding. Year after tear the recipe was changed, massaged, tinkered with and trialed but the only thing that worked was to make the dressing so acidic that the bacteria was killed off. But this made the dressing much less palatable.  By 1983 they had tried so many variations that they essentially said, \"Fuck it, just sell the dressing\". So store bought Ranch was born but is vastly inferior to fresh-made Ranch Dressing--but not many people today know what buttermilk tastes like. So, when you get it at a restaurant where buying a gallon of buttermilk is no big deal and you get fresh Ranch Dressing it tastes nothing like what you can get in a bottle."

Plus pay is regionally dependent, so $100k means wildly different things in California or Iowa.  Here's the big picture.  Find out what you like doing.  No I don't mean \"I want to be a X when I grow up.\". I mean the tasks/activities you like doing.  Think about what you want to do every minute of every day for the next 30 years.  What activities will you find enjoyable thousands of days in a row?  Thinking like this brings clarity to the whole idea of career.  It's not the title or degree.  It's what you're actually going to do day in, day out, for the rest of your working life.  As for me, I understood this part way through college.  I changed majors a few times until I found something that really fit me well.  And I started picking employers based on what daily activities they can offer me based on their business, processes, products, customers, work force, my position within the company, opportunity for growth and advancement, etc.  I picked my career and employer based on what I'd actually do.  And for that, the reward is I go to work and play all day.  I don't dread going in Monday.  I'm not rushing to leave at 5pm Friday.    Because of my choices, I get to do cool stuff.  Like just this last half year I re-laid out our entire factory using years of production data to set up work cells, capacity needs, etc., plus designed and pulled in an entirely new production cell for the full production of a new customer.  I also designed and built a next generation product for another customer that's going to replace a legacy product our company had previously designed and built for them.  Next year is going to be a ton of work cell optimization, process optimization, a light revamp of our entire product line and some homogenization work (UL driven requirement), and starting some of our own branded next gen stuff, some of which will greatly improve the performance and features, and modernize the tech.  There's some critical market changes happening that we're also planning for and will introduce new products for that change and own that entire market niche.  Then the 5 year plan gets nutty and if done right will change the entire market space entirely, like epic proportions and how companies exist in the market space will never be the same again.  This is all super cool stuff that I get to do simply because I thought about what I'd actually be doing and what project opportunities existed for me.  What does this career path and what does this employer and job position offer me on a daily basis?  Not what is my degree or job title, no, what do I actually do?  And will that bring me joy, fun, and play?  I haven't actually worked in a decade.  I really haven't.  I've just play all day, and for some reason people keep paying me."

This professor paid me what they promised for the first few years, but then they stopped abruptly. The excuses for why I wasn't getting paid kept building up and changing over time, and as soon as I was on my way out the professor started stonewalling me, on multiple occasions literally just walking out of the room when I tried to talk to them. During the year where I wasn't getting paid, this professor also intentionally sabotaged my efforts to find work elsewhere. They lied about me in emails and over the phone with other professionals in our relatively small field of work. Multiple people in and out of the university contacted me and told me \"Hey, I thought you should know this is what Dr. Professor said about you, and I know that's not true\".  I contacted the dean of my college, and they referred the matter to university legal affairs. I gave Legal copies of emails and written notes from face-to-face conversations where I was promised a salary, they asked me to come in and talk to them, I did, and then they did nothing. I informed them that this professor has done this to at least three other students over the course of at least five years. One of the other students had to drop out because, unlike me, they didn't have any external funding. I gave them piles of documentation, much of it taken from the university's own records, showing how the professor had falsified financial statements, employment records, grant proposals and reports, how the professor was paying students less than promised or nothing at all and using personnel money to buy equipment because they intentionally underestimated their equipment costs to make their grant proposal seem more competitive. University legal still did nothing. I contacted them again to ask if they needed any additional information from me, if they had planned or taken any corrective action, if they were planning on paying me my wages, no response of any kind.  Granted, they have been busy the past few weeks with coaches taking bribes from celebrities, but I spoke to them months before that. As far as I know, at this point my only option is to just sue the university directly. They have a massive legal department and they've argued in front of SCOTUS multiple times in the past few years, so I have no idea if or how I should approach this, but the simple fact of the matter is that this professor owes me $14,000 in unpaid wages, I have written statements promising me that amount, they slandered me in professional settings, and they're lying to the university and the federal government about how they're using research funds. What are the odds of suing a top-tier public research university with a multi-billion-dollar endowment and coming out ahead?  I'm in Texas if that's relevant.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I’m a PI and manage multiple grants, student stipends & lab staff. Student payment is complicated legally because it’s sometimes exempt from some aspects of employment law, due to the fact that the student is a student and therefore the job tasks can sometimes be cast as part of the student’s education. Further, funding that is coming from grants is complex as well - that’s considered “soft money” and is often assumed to be basically yankable at any second with no warning, due to the fact that the university is not controlling those funds, the PI is. So - what *exactly* did your advisor say? Sadly it is very common for informal discussions of grant funding to be unenforcable without a written contract. Did you ever get a contract? If what the prof told you was something like “I think I’ll have a $14,000 RA for you in spring semester” you may be out of luck.  Re the grants, what exactly did your advisor lie about on proposals and reports? The two deadly sins are falsifying actual data, and embezzling grants funds; did either of those occur? The cases you describe of underestimating equipment costs, and spending personal funds to cover the shortfall, are both ok. Pretty large deviations in the budget line items & in the exact work tasks done are generally allowed as long as the PI has made a good-faith effort to accomplish the grant’s scientific goals, did not falsify data, and did not actually embezzle funds.

    "sft_question": "Question: Masters in CS with a Bach in Mechanical Engineering.    Hi everyone, so I have a bachelor in mechanical engineering but since the final year of my degree that I've wanted to pursue a career as a software developer. Since I have basic knowledge in Visual Basic, C and Java, I talked to the main professor of the masters degree program in COMP SCI, at my university, and he told me that I could enroll in, as long as I took the 4 main classes from the undergrad curriculum. Those classes are \" Software engineering\", \"Data Bases\", \"Systems Architecture\" and \"Intro to programming\". So my question is, Do u think I should enroll in the masters program, or do something else ?  Extra: In my country the masters program is 2 years long and the tuitions aren´t as crazy as in the US.  Sorry if my English is not perfect, it's not my main language.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Switching to software development is probably less complicated and formal than you think.  As an Electronics Engineer, I've done firmware and software development, including at a web- and app-development firm.  Or my brother, for instance, had only a semester of college and worked as a video editor at several news organizations. He recently decided \"Naw, this isn't going anywhere\" and is currently in the latter half of a coding bootcamp.  At the web-development firm I worked in, a couple of them came from bootcamps. To my frustration, making pretty much the same as me. One of the guys I worked with closely never got a degree or formal training, but left the company to do his own contracts and make well into six figures.  Oh, and our resident \"AI Expert\" had a degree in physics and started at the company doing QA testing.  With software, the skills count almost entirely and formal education counts for comparatively little. Mind you, having an engineering degree under your belt will IMMEDIATELY make you stand out and get your foot in the door. In my experience, people respected my EE degree more than others' CS degrees.  But I would say if you go for a Master's in CS, your primary motivation should be the skills, not  necessarily the degree."

I was just cleaning my mom’s mouth and checking her over when I noticed that her neck under her chin is really puffed up. I touched it and it’s rock hard. She is in her final days of life and is no longer eating or drinking anything (except for about a teaspoon of water I’m able to get her to swallow every now and then). I called hospice and they aren’t sure what could be causing it. Hospice started her on liquid lorazepam (2.5ml every 8 hours) and took her off of all of her other meds days ago, one being her thyroid medication. It doesn’t seem to be impacting her breathing any, but it still has me concerned. Does anyone know what could be causing this?  Additional info: My mom is 64F, 5’4”, approx 140 lbs.

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: Students should be taught how to read scientific literature in high school Hopefully this counts for fresh topic friday. I’ve seen posts talking about covering “real world” skills like taxes and stuff but nothing like this specifically.   There’s a very strong distrust of media and government in society, specifically regarding medical/scientific matters. I can’t say that distrust is unjustified either. You should always try and confirm the validity of what you read or hear. The issue is the average person doesn’t know how to discern what is and isn’t credible. I think the solution is to teach high school students how to read scientific articles.   You might think there’s too much jargon and specific knowledge for someone not in the field to understand. I disagree. When I was in college I took a course called “Communication in Biology.” It was an alternative for an English gen ed course for bio majors. It obviously focused on biology, but it taught the skills needed to get the gist of the article even in a topic you know nothing about. For example, I could understand the general concepts and credibility of a publication on climate change despite having no formal education on the matter. I may not understand every piece of it, but I can tell if a news article is accurately extrapolating the conclusions of the research article.   To implement this in high schools, this could be done in either science or English courses, or split between both. It would go over the main components of a scientific article: abstract, methods, results, conclusions, and citations. There would be a basic rundown of statistical analysis. Not necessarily how it is calculated (though That would be great to teach in math class) but rather just understanding what p values, CI, standard deviations, etc. measure and how to tell if a value is statistically significant.   Students would be taught how to answer the following questions: -What question did the researchers aim to answer? -what conclusion did they come to? -Does the data actually support that conclusion?  I can currently see two problems with this idea.   1. Finding space for it in curriculum. My solution to this would be for it to be spread out over the span of high school, not all at once. That way nothing large would have to be cut from a single course. It could also be covered partially in both science and English classes since it involves reading comprehension. Stats could be done in math class as well.   2. There is the problem of accessibility of research articles outside an academic setting. Most people won’t have institutional access to scientific journals all their lives and teachers can’t suggest something that’s technically illegal (Scihub). I don’t think it makes it unnecessary to teach, however. It teaches students to think critically about what they’re reading. That applies to all media they read, not just scholarly articles. And hopefully someday we’ll end paywalls on research articles.  This seems like a really good idea that should be implemented so I’m interested in hearing any problems with it that I haven’t considered. One thing I will say isn’t going to change my mind: anecdotes of “my school already teaches this” unless you can show me that it’s already happening in a large number of schools.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I feel a significant factor that you have overlooked is that even if these children could access and read the papers, none of them would be able to understand the content, nor would they be able to recognise the difference between a good paper and a not so good paper. They might know what a paper is but it would end there. You mention media, but there are also papers out there which are just as manipulative, or indeed manipulated (see retractionwatch). Knowing what a t-test is useless if a child is looking up papers just to confirm their bias, especially if they can’t tell if something looks fishy.  Experts are the ones who can understand and interpret the data. They are the ones who can be trusted to communicate. Perhaps the blame and the solution both lie with the media."

    "sft_answer": "You may want to blend in with the company culture; this way there will be less friction with people particularly if you are new. You want to look like everyone else. HR will interpret this as \"business casual\". If you deviate from cookie cutter looks, you will be seen by many as a rebel, even if they don't admit it. Being a \"team player\" is really important, even if it means changing your appearance. You see, some people will be resentful if you deviate, because they themselves hold this to their standards, and they don't think it is fair that the new guy can get away with it. But what really matters in the end, is what your manager thinks of you. You will help your manager to like you if you \"NPC\" your looks.    I work in the defense industry, so looking clean cut (like military personnel) will give you brownie points. We often bring military clients into our facilities, and they are used to clean cut individuals. Managers like to show that their employees have the \"soldier\" discipline, even if the messege is conveyed through just looks. Unconscious biases exists. And you may want to swim with the current on this one. I just think this is the most optimum path.    Many will disagree with me. I'm sure you can take a different path successfully as well. But, isn't it better to have a \"culturally accepted look\" and not worry about any complications that may come because you wanted to \"complicate\" things? I'm sure your manager appreciates that you are easy and uncomplicated.   This is coming from a previously long haired, big bearded hippie looking dude.

    "sft_question": "Question: AITA for accidentally putting a hit out on my best friend, imprisoning my wife, and not giving my sons every little thing they want? I (40M) and my wife (51F) have four sons(18, 16, 15, and 7) and three daughters (17, 11, and 8). I also have a son (21M) from a previous relationship. My wife brought substantial property into our marriage, and I want to keep as much of it as possible.   Until recently, my best friend (51?M), business partner and all-around confidante and partner-in-crime, had gotten along great. And then I decided to promote him to become Archbishop of Canterbury, thinking that things would stay the same. He and I would be as thick as thieves, and we could effectively rule England, Normandy, Anjou, Brittany and Aquitaine together, and everything would be great! We had previously been working to acquire more land and income for the English crown by leaving bishoprics vacant and collecting on the revenues, but as soon as he was named Archbishop, was suddenly not on my side anymore. He suddenly wanted secular clerks tried in church courts instead of secular courts, and declared that funds I had given him AS A LOAN were actually GIFTS! This is someone I trusted! I trusted him to educate my son and heir!   I tried to let him off easy. When I summoned the Bishops to Clarendon, I tried to give him a way out, and let him compromise, but he refused. I was forced to point out that his own spending as Chancellor was completely contrary to his current position on clerical spending practices. He was okay with it before I promoted him! And now that I've given him the status and power I thought he wanted, he's using it against me!!!   So anyways, he fled to France because obviously he couldn't defend himself against me. Then he goes and starts excommunicating my other advisers and some of my other bishops! Then he wrote to the Pope and they threatened to place all of England under interdict! Imagine that, no weddings, no absolution, no burials... I couldn't have that, so I had to negotiate with the bloody coward. Then, as he's returning to England, he excommunicates MORE of my Bishops! I was at dinner when I heard, so I said to the room \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born cleric!\"   Now, I was just angry. Anybody who knows me, knows that I can get angry and that I say things I don't mean. But four of my knights, some of whom had worked for my late brother (28M), whose marriage to the richest single girl in England had been blocked by this meddlesome priest, went to Canterbury and murdered the Archbishop! I didn't ORDER them to do it. I didn't hold a sword to their throat and make them go do it. But people are saying it's my fault!   Now, three years later, after I did my penance, I thought everything was alright. I met a hot, younger woman (25F) and have been seeing her on the side since my wife is getting on in years and spends most of her time at her summer house in the South with our second son (16M). Now, our eldest (18M) keeps begging me for some estates of his own to govern. But he's irresponsible with money, and would rather fight in tournaments than learn the business of ruling. And my mother always said it was better to keep your falcons begging for scraps than to keep them well fed. So I keep telling him no. His older half-brother (21M) doesn't ask for anything!   But then I hear he's run off to his mother's place, and that they're all on their way to Paris to meet with my eldest son's father-in-law (who also happens to by my wife's ex-husband) to plot a war against me! They say that I have forfeited the crown when I had the Archbishop of Canterbury murdered! Again, I didn't order it. Some of my men captured my wife, and I have her imprisoned to make sure my sons behave, but I hear they're taking up arms against me and several of my nobles are following suit.  Did I put a hit out on my best friend? Is my wife mad about the other woman? Should I have given into my sons' constant requests for money? AITA?   TL;DR: My best friend betrayed me, and I got angry. Some of my men killed him in my name. My wife and sons are rebelling. AITA?   Edit: Oh, I also just got a message saying that the King of Scotland is invading too, great.\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "YTA, your majesty. Maybe you get angry and say things you don't mean, but you're the king. You're responsible for the behavior of your underlings and minions.

This is inspired by the Serious Eats reverse sear method of cooking prime rib:  I have a 4.6lb boneless prime rib roast (chuck end, I believe). Last night I rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and it's been sitting uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. I intend to reverse sear it, first low and slow at 235F for 4-6 hours (or whatever it takes to get to 132F), rest it for 20-30m, then blast it at 500F for 5-10 minutes (or whatever it takes to crust it. I've done this method in the past without tenting, and I was very happy with the results.  But while rubbing with SPGp, a bunch fell off into the pan. Of course that'll burn if left dry in the pan. So I though about adding beef broth for the low and slow part of the cook. Then I thought about tenting it to keep the liquid from evaporating too quickly.  I'm thinking the tenting might give me additional flavor in the jus, and maybe make the roast more fall-apart juicy and tender.  At the end of the slow cook, I'd remove the roast from the oven to rest for 20-30m. I'd strain off the pan juices (if any) and mix with the deli-provided au jus. Then I'd blast at 500F, carve and serve.  I have questions:  * Am I thinking right about getting better results by tenting and essentially 'steaming' it? * How will steaming affect the duration of the cook? It should go much quicker, right? * How will the 'steaming' affect the final crusting? Will I be able to achieve that crust at the end? * I'm wondering if removing the tent part-way through to pour off the juices, remove the roast from the oven, taking the time to empty the pan and wipe it out, then putting the roast back in to finish the slow part of the cook is a wrong move that could cause the meat to toughen. Should I do this at the very end? Or earlier than that to dry the crust a bit? Am I overthinking this? * I'd like to add rosemary and thyme to the crust, but of course they'll burn at the end. When is a good time to rub with herbs? Beginning? Early? Late? Never? It's too late to do it last night. * I heard of somebody also rubbing with brown sugar to help the crust, is this a thing? Should I? * Is there anything that I'm not thinking about?  Any advice that improves this is very much appreciated. Thanks everyone for any replies and Happy New Year to you!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "First, I would definitely not tent it. You're going to ruin your crust. And since you're reverse searing, there are going to be minimal pan juices anyway.  Second, what do your want your final temp to be? Through a ton of trial and error, I've found 133 to be my ideal, but I know plenty of people like it closer to 137. In order to hit 133, I cook at 225 until 118 internal. Then remove and crank the oven to 500 degrees. Then back in for about three minutes. Then rest for 30 minutes. The temp stops rising right around 133. Then when I cut there are barely any juices on the board and almost edge to edge medium rare.   If you pull yours at 132 and rest it for thirty minutes it's going to be at about 140 degrees when you pop it back in for the 5-10 minute sear at 500, and probably 150ish after resting. Your final product is going to be medium well."

    "sft_answer": "Since I learned how to make authentic bolognese, it changed everything I know about browning meat. Here's what you should do for one meal's worth of ground beef:  Get a cast iron pan with a lid. In my experience a Dutch oven works best.  On medium heat add half a stick of butter and a few glugs of olive oil or bacon fat. Fat is very important here.  Chop up a half cup of celery, onion, garlic, and carrots (for mexican food add green chilis if you like). Use a food processor if possible. The smaller the pieces the better. Cook the veg until it almost melts. DO NOT LET IT BROWN. If it browns, start over. Start on lower heat until you find your happy place.   Salt and pepper. (Taco seasoning for Mexican).  After 20 minutes add 1.5 - 2 pounds of beef or pork or combination. This is where you'll have your mind blown. Cook the meat on medium heat until all the liquid is burned off. You'll see and smell the meat starting to get really brown and crackle as it fries in the fat. A fond will appear in the pan (dark, burned pieces stuck to the bottom of the pan.) Scrape it up as you stir. This is the magic. Should take thirty minutes.   For italian, add a small can of tomato paste and cook for another twenty minutes. Deglaze with half cup milk. Add half a bottle of white wine, cook off most of the alcohol, cover, and cook on low for one hour.   For mexican I like to use a packet (or two) of taco seasoning when I add salt and pepper. That and the chilis is really the only difference between mexican and italian.  Serve the Italian version with pasta. Mexican for tacos or taco salad. Once you taste the flavor of the meat you'll never go back to boring old browned ground beef. Trust me. You can make a bunch at one time and eat it throughout the week.

    "sft_question": "Question: AskScience AMA Series: I'm Dr. Jonathan Blutinger, a postdoctoral researcher in the Creative Machines Lab at Columbia University, developing a \"digital chef\" that can 3D print and laser cook edible items. Ask me anything about the process! Hello all, after my MSc in Integrated Product Design at the University of Pennsylvania and a year stint in industry designing pick-and-place robots, I started working as a Ph.D. researcher (Mechanical Engineering) at Hod Lipson's (He co-launched the world's first open-source 3D printer which could be used for food) Creative Machines Lab where I tinker with digital cooking techniques using food printers and lasers. We've experimented with dough, meats, vegetables, sweets, made a seven-ingredient slice of cheesecake, and printed chicken samples which were then cooked by lasers. Currently, we are focusing on building robust software and hardware to incorporate more functionality to print food of different consistencies and multi-ingredient combinations to fully showcase this tech's potential.  In August 2022, my work was featured in Interesting Engineering, and the publication helped organize this AMA session. Ask me anything about the technology behind 3D-printed food, the how-tos on printing food, how lasers can cook food, how 3D-printed food can be inventive, nutritious, and customized for each individual.  I will be replying to messages with the username \"IntEngineering\" at noon ET (17 UT), AMA!\nAnswer: ",

    "sft_answer": "I worked at the airport and helped passengers through arrivals immigration. As someone posted already, checking through the system to see if there are any red flags that would prevent you from entering the country such as warrants, if you have the proper visa if you are coming from a different country, over staying your visit last time you came into the country, past deportations, if you are a legal US resident, a lot things really.   If you have the same name as a known criminal/person who is not allowed into the country, the system will flag it and the officer needs to manually verify you are not that person. It happened to an elderly passenger whose name happened to be the same as a few known criminals, so the officer had to check name by name that it wasn’t the elderly passenger. There was a handful of names and the officer took a lot longer because of it.   If you are also traveling with babies, toddlers or young children, than can also make it longer because the officer is making sure you are not trafficking in children."

    "sft_question": "Question: Cooking a prime rib roast for New Year's Eve. I'm considering a refinement to my reverse-sear method, please advise me. This is inspired by the Serious Eats reverse sear method of cooking prime rib:  I have a 4.6lb boneless prime rib roast (chuck end, I believe). Last night I rubbed it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and it's been sitting uncovered in the refrigerator overnight. I intend to reverse sear it, first low and slow at 235F for 4-6 hours (or whatever it takes to get to 132F), rest it for 20-30m, then blast it at 500F for 5-10 minutes (or whatever it takes to crust it. I've done this method in the past without tenting, and I was very happy with the results.  But while rubbing with SPGp, a bunch fell off into the pan. Of course that'll burn if left dry in the pan. So I though about adding beef broth for the low and slow part of the cook. Then I thought about tenting it to keep the liquid from evaporating too quickly.  I'm thinking the tenting might give me additional flavor in the jus, and maybe make the roast more fall-apart juicy and tender.  At the end of the slow cook, I'd remove the roast from the oven to rest for 20-30m. I'd strain off the pan juices (if any) and mix with the deli-provided au jus. Then I'd blast at 500F, carve and serve.  I have questions:  * Am I thinking right about getting better results by tenting and essentially 'steaming' it? * How will steaming affect the duration of the cook? It should go much quicker, right? * How will the 'steaming' affect the final crusting? Will I be able to achieve that crust at the end? * I'm wondering if removing the tent part-way through to pour off the juices, remove the roast from the oven, taking the time to empty the pan and wipe it out, then putting the roast back in to finish the slow part of the cook is a wrong move that could cause the meat to toughen. Should I do this at the very end? Or earlier than that to dry the crust a bit? Am I overthinking this? * I'd like to add rosemary and thyme to the crust, but of course they'll burn at the end. When is a good time to rub with herbs? Beginning? Early? Late? Never? It's too late to do it last night. * I heard of somebody also rubbing with brown sugar to help the crust, is this a thing? Should I? * Is there anything that I'm not thinking about?  Any advice that improves this is very much appreciated. Thanks everyone for any replies and Happy New Year to you!\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "I use the \"sear first, cook slow\" method described here:  https://blog.thermoworks.com/beef/rib-roast/  Since I've been doing that, every roast (and I've cooked a LOT of them) have come out 100% perfect with boring regularity.  Best part is that the rib cap doesn't get overcooked.  You get perfect medium all the way through.  I season 24 hrs ahead of time (Montreal steak seasoning), roast sits in the fridge uncovered so it dries off nice for the inital sear.  Proof."

    "sft_question": "Question: I'd take a pay hit if I take a new job; should I negotiate? Also, will I be burning bridges if I take the new job? [x-posted] I've been in my current job as a Quality Manager for 3.5 years. I had two promotions in that time and have gotten 115% of my merit bonuses each year, due to doing a good job here. It's my 2nd job out of college; I was in my first job for about 4 years. Although I'm a manager level, I don't manage anyone but interns - I have a hunch they gave me this promotion and title change so I wouldn't leave. (We have a really high turnover, so someone like me who has been here for a while is more valuable as time goes on.)  At the start of this month, I recently switched to a different area in Quality but kept my title. I just wanted a change in the type of work I was doing, a spot was open, I'd worked for the director before, so I figured it would be a good spot. Plus, I've been bored for quite a while.  Well, last week I got an email from a recruiter that actually sparked my interest. I have a phone screen today with HR before I presumably move to the next level to an in-person interview with the hiring manager.  My issues are:  1. I'd take a 10% pay hit if I take this job. (Big con.)  1. I'd have a title change back down to a Senior Engineer. (Slight con.)  1. My work-life balance would be immensely better. (Huge pro.)  1. My commute would be 40% of what it is now, and I wouldn't have to pay tolls each way. (Pro.)  1. The job responsibilities are nearly identical to the one I just switched out of internally at my current employer; the only difference is that it's in a different industry with all sorts of regulations I've never dealt with before. (Neutral.)  1. They've been looking to fill this position since November, so they are likely really eager to hire someone with my experience. (Slight pro.)  If all goes well in the interview process, I'll likely accept this job. My two questions are:  1. Would I be burning bridges by accepting the new job? I just started a kinda-new position at my current employer and I feel like I may be screwing them over by leaving so soon after this switch.  1. Given that they are likely really eager to hire someone for this long-open position, and given that I'd be taking a pay cut (and they'd be aware of this when I tell them my salary requirement) do I have an opportunity to negotiate salary, benefits, etc. with them? I've never had to do such a thing before, and part of me would like some extra compensation for taking the pay hit. However, given that my title will no longer be a \"Manager\", would it be ridiculous of me to still want to be compensated like one?\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "Sounds like you may be counting your chickens before they hatch.  However, definitely try to negotiate.  Don't use your current pay.  Research salaries for similar positions and experience.  Give them the range that you are looking at.  Don't worry about burning bridges.  Managers understand employees do what is best for themselves."

I am very fascinated inaerospace and robots in general but that won’t be an option unless I move to a better country.  Thanks for your insights\nAnswer: ",
    "sft_answer": "In my mind this isn't an either/or situation. A good engineer in this day and age should be an expert Excel user *and* know a a language like Python fairly well. If you know Python, you wouldn't need to double down with VBA though.   There are times where a spreadsheet is the right tool. There are also times where you need to automate something or do some serious data crunching and Python (along with Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, matplotlib, Plotly, etc.) is often the best solution.  In my experience, knowing a programming language makes a mechanical engineer a far more valuable asset, and it will make you more desirable in the job market. I would always suggest starting with Python, but depending on your domain of problems, learning additional languages like Julia or Go can be extremely useful as well."

    "sft_question": "Question: CMV: A salaried worker who only needs to work 40 hours a week should never (unless ABSOLUTELY necessary) work a single minute beyond that. I have worked with such people all over the place. They routinely put in 9-10 hour days when they are only required to work 8. From what I can tell, generally it is not anything pressing. There is no imminent deadline. They simply choose to continue working when they could easily continue the work tomorrow (which they generally always need to do anyway).  Above all else, it's a matter of getting the most out of your life. 90% of people are not happy with their jobs, so it's highly unlikely that anyone who is presently at work is enjoying their life more than they would be if they were not at work.  Simply put, there is no legal requirement for you to work beyond this. An employer cannot force you to stay at work beyond 40 hours as a salaried employee. Are there fires to fight sometimes? Sure! Please do note that I'm accounting for this, that sometimes you do need to stay late. But in my experience, the people who stay late often aren't doing it because of all the crises they are fighting; they are simply choosing to stay at work longer.  If you have a job where you ARE constantly fighting fires and having to stay late, then the smart thing to do would be to get a new job, one that actually allows you to go home at time. Those jobs exist. Don't lie to yourself and say they don't.  Why can't you walk out the door at quitting time? Why can't that task wait until tomorrow? Your company hired you to work 40 hours a week. This is why, when you're sick, you are deducted 8 hours, not 9 or 10. They can't tell you you HAVE to stay late, and if they DO, then get the hell out of that job.  Honestly, the employees I see that routinely stay late are, in fact, very INefficient workers. A great example of when I had to stay late recently was a meeting scheduled for 60 minutes, yet it went for 90, and all we did was review and discuss 5 slides of data. 5. But the people in this meeting took incredibly circuitous routes in making their points and simply could not summarize their thoughts or get beyond the \"analysis paralysis\". And because of this I got to watch one fewer episode of Modern Family which I love dearly.  The only legit reason I can think of to stay late is if you want more money or want promotions and what not. But I reject the notion that money will make you happy, and if that happiness comes at the expense of actually having the time to spend it, then what's the point? Working hard at a job you don't like to make more money is like trying to get yourself comfy on a tight airplane seat vs. lying down on a cushy sofa. There's a clear winner here.  To sum up: HAVE to stay late too much? Get a new job. Insist that your work really does take you 9-10 hours? Get more efficient. Remember that you are likely among the 90% of people who dislikes your job, so spending so much as 1 extra minute on it is like willingly setting your hands on a hot stove.\nAnswer: ",

A common justification for student loan debt forgiveness in the US suggests that 18 year olds have not yet completed neurophysiological brain development and therefore lack the maturity to take on financial commitments.   I contest this notion on the basis that the majority of students are required to pass standardized testing such as the ACT or SAT, with decent scores, prior to being admitted to high cost universities and colleges. This standardized testing includes a math component. Arguably, demonstrating a certain competency in maths prior to college admission would also cover competency in Googling a compound interest calculator on the internet, and comparing these numbers against average salaries for a chosen degree.   As a summary, I argue that ACT/SAT competency in math as a requirement for college admissions is sufficient moral justification for placing financial burden on 18 year olds.\nAnswer: ",

Page 621, Microbiology 10th edition by Tortora, Funke, and Case:      >Why  did  this  disease  appear  so  suddenly?  The  answer  is paradoxical- probably  because  of  improved  sanitation.  Polioviruses  can  remain  infectious for  relatively  long periods in  water and food. The primary mode of transmission  is  ingestion  of  water  contaminated  with  feces  containing  the  virus.  Improved  sanitation  delayed  exposure  to  polioviruses  in  feces  until after  the protection  provided  by maternal antibodies had  waned. At  one  time  (and  today in  parts of  the world  with  poor sanitation),  exposure  to  the  poliovirus  was  frequent.  Infants  were  usually  exposed  to  poliovirus  while  still  protected by  maternal  antibodies.  The  result  was  usually  an  asymptomatic  case  of the disease and a  lifelong  immunity.

The scenario is like this; China is currently interring the Uyghurs and effectively committing genocide by forcibly sterilising the population.  My view is that countries “in the west” should coerce China to stop this activity and if it led to the use of military force then so be it.  The counter-argument both parties I’ve talked to with have said that it is not “the west’s” job to impose its views on other countries (effectively anti-imperialism) and that morality is subjective, something I disagree with strongly in the situation of right to freedom.  I also feel this way about North Korea, Iran, Syria and Saudi Arabia. “The west” should intervene in any country where basic human rights are not respected.  Wherever there are people who are oppressed by a regime, it is morally reprehensible, to me, to not use every method available to assist them.   The argument to me that “they will figure it out for themselves” is completely devoid of humanity. That is to say that the pain and suffering of people in these countries right now will pay off later when that country becomes “enlightened”.   How would I feel living in these societies with the knowledge that life does not have to be this way, that there are countries who are incredibly powerful, more so than mine, that could help but don’t?

    "sft_answer": "As other posters have mentioned, human rights are quite subjective from nation to nation. To many countries, the US is actually not respecting human rights by forcibly imprisoning immigrants, seperating children from their families, performing hysteroctomies on female migrants... not to mention that neither education nor healthcare is a given right, when many other developed nations do see it as such.   So my question to you is, should all the other nations who see healthcare, education, and like not imprisoning children as a human right, should they forcibly coerce the United States into respecting their human rights?   Perhaps from your American perspective,  your society is the moral society, but to many others it is not. And to go around trying to coerce other nations through either violence or cultural imperialism most often - well actually always devolves into more violence and destabilizes countries, which then only increases human rights violations.   This is why in part we developed the United Nations, so that nations around the world could come together to discuss what human rights should be respected, and for the ICC to deter and hold accountable those who seek to flout international law."
